<h1 id="Introduction"> Introduction </h1>
<br>Documentation for programs in the form of help files can make the user's life much easier.&nbsp; The Open Watcom OS/2
 Help Compiler produces such documentation for the OS/2 operating system's Information Presentation Facility (IPF).&nbsp;
 It consumes text documents containing special IPF tags, commands, and (optionally) bit-mapped graphics, and outputs help
 files in the .inf or .hlp formats.
<br><br>The IPF tags are similar to other SGML tags, the most familiar of which is likely HTML.&nbsp; The IPF tags allow you,
 the documentation author, to:
<ul>
<li>Specify the source (highlighted text or regions of an image) and destination of hyper-link jumps
<li>Set right and left text margins
<li>Create lists, footnotes, notes, and various other kinds of notices
<li>Create tables
<li>Add illustrations in the form of examples, text figures, and bit-mapped graphics
<li>Change the size, style, and color of displayed text
<li>Change whether text spacing and new lines in the source are significant or not
<li>Customize the behavior of windows in the help viewer
<li>Create communication links to other applications
</ul>
<br>This document provides a basic description of how tags are used ( <a href="#Using_IPF_Tags">Using IPF Tags</a>) as well
 as a complete reference for each tag ( <a href="#IPF_Tag_Reference">IPF Tag Reference</a>).&nbsp; For more advanced topics,
 please refer to IBM's &quot;IPF Programming Guide and Reference&quot; (ipfref.inf) which is available on the internet.
<h1 id="Using_the_Open_Watcom_OSD2_Help_Compiler"> Using the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler </h1>
<br>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler is a command line utility.&nbsp; It may be invoked as follows:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wipfc &#91;options&#93; input.ipf</tt>
<h2 id="Environment_Variables"> Environment Variables </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler depends upon several environment variables that must be set correctly before wipfc
 is run.
<dl>
<dt>WIPFC
<dd>This must be set to %watcom%\wipfc, which is the location of the files defining the local language encoding.
<dt><br>IPFCARTWORK
<dd>Must point to your source of bit-mapped graphic images if your source file uses any.
<dt><br>IPFCIMBED
<dd>Must point to your source of input files if your main source file includes other source files.
<dt><br>TMP
<dd>Must point to a directory where temporary files that are generated by Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler can be stored.
</dl>
<h2 id="Command_Line_Flags"> Command Line Flags </h2>
<br>The behavior of the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler can be altered using command line options.&nbsp; Each flag begins with
 a delimiter.&nbsp; Either '-' or '/' can be used.&nbsp; Each flag is given a longer descriptive name here, but only the first
 character after the delimiter is actually significant.&nbsp; Flag names are not case-sensitive.
<h3 id="Switches"> Switches </h3>
<br>The switches change the state of the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler in a yes/no fashion.
<dl>
<dt>Name
<dd>Description
<dt><br>inf
<dd>Generate an 'inf' file.&nbsp; Otherwise a 'hlp' file is created by default.
<dt><br>quiet
<dd>Operate quietly, suppressing the usual copyright information display.
<dt><br>suppress-search
<dd>Suppress the generation of the full-text search table in the output file.&nbsp; This makes the help file smaller, but the
 user can't search for individual words.
<dt><br>xref
<dd>Generate additional output information, including a cross-reference of identifiers.&nbsp; This is saved in a file 'output-name.log'
 where 'output-name' is the base name of the help file being created.
</dl>
<h3 id="Options"> Options </h3>
<br>The options give additional information to the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler Each option is immediately followed by the
 information to be passed into wipfc.
<h4 id="localization"> localization </h4>
<br>Help files can be created for different locales.&nbsp; This is done by using the<b> localization</b> option in the form
 of
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -l xx_YY</tt>
<br><br>where xx_YY is the name of the locale (for example, en_US).&nbsp; The localization information is store in a text
 file (en_US.nls in this case).&nbsp; You can create your own locales from the sample file xx_YY.nls, but you may also need
 to create a corresponding entity file containing the definitions of <a href="#IPF_Symbols">IPF Symbols</a>.
<h4 id="outputMname"> output-name </h4>
<br>You can specify the name of the help file that wipfc generates by using the<b> output-name</b> option.&nbsp; For example,
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -o MyHelp</tt>
<br><br>will cause wipfc to generate an output file (either inf or hlp depending on the -inf switch) with a base name of 'MyHelp'
<h4 id="warningMlevel"> warning-level </h4>
<br>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler generates three different levels of warnings (1, 2, and 3).&nbsp; By default, all levels
 of warnings are displayed.&nbsp; You can suppress the display of warnings higher than level<b> n</b> by using the<b> warning-level</b>
 option.&nbsp; For example,
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -w1</tt>
<br><br>suppresses all warnings higher than level 1.
<h1 id="Using_IPF_Tags"> Using IPF Tags </h1>
<br>Source files for the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler consist of text (words, whitespace, punctuation, and entity references),
 markup tags, and commands.&nbsp; Each markup tags is described in detail elsewhere ( <a href="#IPF_Tag_Reference">IPF Tag Reference</a>),
 as are the commands ( <a href="#Using_IPF_Commands">Using IPF Commands</a>).
<br><br>Tags come in four flavors:
<ol>
<li>Tags that appear in the document header and control how the document behaves.
<li>Tags that establish blocks.&nbsp; These tags can contain other tags as well as text.
<li>Tags that are in-line and contain text or other in-line tags.
<li>Formatting tags that can appear anywhere, but are usually in-line.
</ol>
<h2 id="Text"> Text </h2>
<br>Text consists of words, whitespace, punctuation, and entity references (symbols).
<h3 id="Words"> Words </h3>
<br>Words consist of letters and/or numbers (ABC123 is a single word, for example).&nbsp; Which letters are valid depends
 upon the current locale.&nbsp; For the default locale (en_US, code page 850), the upper and lower case ASCII letters are
 allowed (A-Z, a-z).&nbsp; Other letters can be included via entity references.
<h3 id="Whitespace"> Whitespace </h3>
<br>Whitespace consists of spaces, tabs, and new-line characters.&nbsp; Usually, single whitespace characters are not significant,
 but multiple whitespace characters are.&nbsp; Tab characters are not expanded, so count as a single whitespace character.
&nbsp; New-lines are generally ignored.
<br><br>Some tags create blocks where some or all forms of whitespace become significant.&nbsp; In these cases, new-line characters
 will cause line breaks and the text will be shown as you have formatted it.&nbsp; If the block is monospaced, spaces as well
 as new-lines will be significant.
<h3 id="Punctuation"> Punctuation </h3>
<br>Punctuation is not part of a word.&nbsp; 'ABC123' is a single word, but 'ABC-123' is actually two words ('ABC' and '123')
 and a punctuation ('-').
<br><br>Some forms of punctuation are used to delimit tags or entity references.&nbsp; When a colon (':') or ampersand ('&amp;')
 begin a word, that word is treated as a tag or entity reference, respectively.&nbsp; Likewise, a period ('.') ends both tags
 and entity references.&nbsp; If you need to use such constructs, replace the punctuation character with an entity reference
 ('&amp;colon.', '&amp;amp.', and '&amp;per.').
<h3 id="Entity_References_LSymbolsR"> Entity References (Symbols) </h3>
<br>Entities are symbolic references to single characters.&nbsp; During processing of the source file, valid entity references
 are removed and the matching single character is substituted.&nbsp; This allows you to include special characters that are
 outside the normal character set (for example, characters with diacriticals) in words.
<br><br>Unless the entity reference is a punctuation symbol, a string of ...-word-entity-word-...&nbsp; (in any order) is
 considered to be a single word.
<br><br>Unrecognized entity references will cause wipfc to generate a warning.&nbsp; Note that all entity references are case
 sensitive:&nbsp; &amp;Alpha.&nbsp; and &amp;alpha.&nbsp; are two different things.
<h2 id="Tag_Syntax"> Tag Syntax </h2>
<br>All tags begin with a colon (':') and end with a period ('.').&nbsp; In addition, many tags have flags or attribute=value
 pairs that appear inside the tag between the tag name and the end-of-tag delimiter ('.').&nbsp; If you forget the end-of-tag
 delimiter, the numerous warnings that wipfc generates will be sure to let you know.
<h2 id="Tag_Attributes"> Tag Attributes </h2>
<br>A tag may have one or more<b> attributes.</b>&nbsp; An attribute contains additional information that a tag needs.&nbsp;
 The attribute has a name, and may also have a value or keyword assigned to it.
<br><br>For example, heading tags have a 'res' attribute that specifies a window identifier (a target for hyper-linked jumps).
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :h1 res=001.How to make Popcorn</tt>
<br><br>In this case, res is assigned the value 001.
<br><br>Notice that attributes are part of the tag, and the end-of-tag delimiter always follows the last attribute.
<br><br>Many tags have multiple attributes.&nbsp; If you like, you can place them on different lines or all on a single line.
&nbsp; If you place them on different lines, however, the attribute and its assigned value must be on the same line.&nbsp;
 Spaces are allowed between the attribute, '=', and the value.&nbsp; If spaces are required within the value, the value must
 be enclosed in matching quotation marks ('', or &quot;&quot;, but not '&quot; or &quot;').
<br><br>Optional attributes all have default values and do not need to be specified unless you need to change the default.
&nbsp; Other attributes are required, and wipfc will issue a warning if they are not specified.
<br><br>Attributes may be specified in any order within a tag.
<br><br>Some attributes may not have a value, in which case the presence of the attribute simply acts as a boolean flag.&nbsp;
 For those attributes that do have values, values can be numeric, text strings (with spaces, if quoted), or keywords.&nbsp;
 For example, the color tag specifies the foreground and/or background color for text.&nbsp; Only certain colors are supported,
 and each has a keyword:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>default
<li>blue
<li>red
<li>pink
<li>green
<li>cyan
<li>yellow
<li>neutral
<li>brown
<li>darkgray
<li>darkblue
<li>darkred
<li>darkpink
<li>darkgreen
<li>darkcyan
<li>black
<li>palegray
</ul>
<h2 id="End_Tags"> End Tags </h2>
<br>Some tags require matching end tags to form an enclosing block of code.&nbsp; The end tag has the same name as the tag
 prefixed with the letter 'e'.&nbsp; For example, if &quot;tag&quot; had an end tag, it would be &quot;etag&quot;.
<h2 id="Nesting_Tags"> Nesting Tags </h2>
<br>Most tags can be arbitrarily nested within other tags.&nbsp; However, some tags can<b> only</b> be nested inside other
 tags.&nbsp; For example, the list-item tag (li) can only appear between opening and closing list tags.
<br><br>In addition, there are a few tags that restrict the kinds of elements that they can contain.&nbsp; If you try to include
 a tag where it doesn't belong, wipfc will issue a warning, the tag will be ignored, and the result will not be what you hoped
 for!
<h2 id="Tags_Requiring_Text"> Tags Requiring Text </h2>
<br>Some tags (for example, heading tags) have text associated with them.&nbsp; This text can appear either immediately after
 the end-of-tag delimiter ('.') or on the next line.&nbsp; Note, however, that in this case the end-of-tag delimiter must
 be immediately followed by a new-line character.&nbsp; No other form of whitespace is allowed.
<h2 id="Units_of_Measure"> Units of Measure </h2>
<br>Several tags have attributes that are measurements of one sort or another (window origin and extent, for example).&nbsp;
 Dimensional measurements can be one of three types:<b>&nbsp; absolute, relative,</b> or<b> dynamic.</b>
<br><br><b>Absolute</b> measurements consist of a number followed by a letter that indicates the unit of measurement.&nbsp;
 The units are:
<ul>
<li>c:&nbsp; the average character width of the default system font.
<li>x:&nbsp; pixels.
<li>p:&nbsp; typographical points (about 1/72 inch).
</ul>
<br><b>Relative</b> measurements consists of a number followed by the percent sign (%).&nbsp; The values is a percentage of
 the parent window width or height.
<br><br><b>Dynamic</b> measurements consist of a keyword.&nbsp; The actual value is computed at run-time based on the current
 size and position of the parent window.&nbsp; The keywords for x-axis values are:
<ul>
<li>left:&nbsp; flush left in the parent window
<li>center:&nbsp; centered in the parent window
<li>right:&nbsp; flush right in the parent window
</ul>
<br>The keywords for y-axis values are:
<ul>
<li>top:&nbsp; at the top of the parent window
<li>center:&nbsp; centered in the parent window
<li>bottom:&nbsp; at the bottom of the parent window
</ul>
<br>Note that the coordinate system for all window measurements has its origin at the lower left corner.&nbsp; Increasingly
 positive values represent movement upward and rightward.
<h1 id="Using_IPF_Commands"> Using IPF Commands </h1>
<br>In addition to tags, the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler recognizes 5 commands (or control words) that invoke special processing
 procedures.&nbsp; Each command must start with a period ('.') in the first column of a line, followed by the name of the
 command.&nbsp; Commands that start anywhere except the first column of a line will be treated as regular text.
<br><br>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler recognizes these commands:
<dl>
<dt>Command
<dd>Description
<dt><br>.*
<dd>Begin a comment.
<dt><br>.br
<dd>Add a line break (start a new line).
<dt><br>.ce
<dd>Center a single line of text.
<dt><br>.im filename
<dd>Imbed (include)<b> filename</b> as if it were text in the current file.
<dt><br>.nameit
<dd>Define a macro for text substitution.
</dl>
<h2 id="Comment"> Comment </h2>
<br>Comments are always useful.&nbsp; They allow you to document your documentation!&nbsp; Any text on a line beginning with
 the comment command (.*) is passed over without further processing.
<br><br>Don't put a comment within a tag, or between a tag and text that must immediately follow it.
<h2 id="br"> br </h2>
<br>There are times when you want to interrupt the normal flow of text and begin a new line.&nbsp; The .br command does just
 that.&nbsp; It must be the only thing on the line.
<br>Any text following a .br command on the same line will be ignored.
<h2 id="ce"> ce </h2>
<br>The ce command (.ce) centers the line of text that follows it.
<br>The single line of text may not contain any other tags, but may contain nameit and entity references.
<h2 id="imbed"> imbed </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler allows source files to be embedded in other source files.&nbsp; The top-most file is
 the master file.&nbsp; The imbed command (.im) is followed by the name of the file to include.&nbsp; This file is then processed
 as if it were in-line with the document including it.
<br><br>The ability to include other files makes it possible to break large documents into smaller, more manageable logical
 chunks.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>The embedded files cannot contain the userdoc and euserdoc tags (see <a href="#userdoc">userdoc</a>).&nbsp; Only the master
 document may contain these tags.
</dl>
<br>The embedded files must be in the current directory or in a directory listed in the IPFCIMBED environment variable (see
 <a href="#Environment_Variables">Environment Variables</a>).&nbsp; Otherwise, a full path name must be used.
<h2 id="nameit"> nameit </h2>
<br>The nameit command creates a text-substitution macro.&nbsp; The nameit command takes two parameters (<b> symbol</b> =name
 and<b> text</b> ='string') that can appear in any order.
<br><br>The<b> symbol</b> parameter is the name of the macro.&nbsp; Symbol names were limited to 10 characters (0-9A-Za-z)
 for the original OS/2 help compiler, but Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler does not have this restriction.&nbsp; Note that the
 '&amp;' character is not part of the symbol name, but is used when referencing the symbol.
<br><br>The<b> text</b> parameter defines 'string' as the text to be substituted on each occurrence of &amp;name.&nbsp; in
 the text.
<br><br>A .nameit symbol is used in the same way as an entity reference.
<h1 id="IPF_Tag_Reference"> IPF Tag Reference </h1>
<br>This section acts as a reference, describing how wipfc implements each tag.
<h2 id="Overview"> Overview </h2>
<br>Tags are the heart of IPF markup and come in four flavors:
<ol>
<li>Tags that appear in the document header.&nbsp; These tags control how the document behaves.
<li>Tags that establish blocks.&nbsp; These tags can contain other tags as well as text.&nbsp; List-blocks and tables are
 special cases in that they can only contain other tags and cannot directly contain text.
<li>Tags that are in-line.&nbsp; These tags can contain text or other in-line tags.
<li>Formatting tags that can appear anywhere, but are usually in-line.
</ol>
<br>This diagram classifies each tag and shows which tags can contain which other tags.&nbsp; Tags that are marked as containing
 'in-line' can also contain formatting and text.

<h1 id="Error_Messages"> Error Messages </h1>
<br>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler generates four kinds of diagnostic messages:&nbsp; Errors and three levels of warnings.
&nbsp; Despite their name, warnings are really errors and indicate that wipfc has produced a file that is probably not exactly
 the way you wanted.
<h2 id="Errors"> Errors </h2>
<br>Errors are always fatal and cause Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler to stop immediately.
<dl>
<dt>&quot;The length of the file path is too long&quot;
<dd>The maximum length of the file path depends on the operating system.&nbsp; You may need to re-arrange the project's layout
 on disk.
<dt><br>&quot;Cannot open file&quot;
<dd>A source file cannot be opened, usually because it doesn't exist.&nbsp; Check the spelling of the file name.
<dt><br>&quot;Cannot open image file&quot;
<dd>A image file cannot be opened, usually because it doesn't exist.&nbsp; Check the spelling of the file name.
<dt><br>&quot;Cannot read from file&quot;

<dd>For some reason, writing to the file has failed.&nbsp; The disk might be full.
<dt><br>&quot;Unexpected end of file&quot;
<dd>The source file has unexpectedly ended.&nbsp; This can occur if you have forgotten the euserdoc tag.
<dt><br>&quot;Text conversion error&quot;
<dd>wipfc uses wide characters internally.&nbsp; All text is converted from multi-byte characters to wide characters when read,
 and back to multi-byte characters when written.&nbsp; If a character cannot be converted successfully, this error is generated.
<dt><br>&quot;Syntax error&quot;
<dd>A syntax error has occurred.&nbsp; Usually, this is because an end-of-tag delimiter is missing.
<dt><br>&quot;Invalid country code or codepage&quot;
<dd>The appropriate file of entity references cannot be found or cannot be read.&nbsp; Usually, this is because the WIPFC environment
 variable is pointing to the wrong place.
<dt><br>&quot;Invalid language code&quot;
<dd>The appropriate nls file cannot be found or cannot be read.&nbsp; Usually, this is because the WIPFC environment variable
 is pointing to the wrong place.

<h2 id="Level_1_Warnings"> Level 1 Warnings </h2>
<br>Level 1 warnings are the most serious.&nbsp; Unless they are corrected, your help file is not likely to contain information
 presented as you intended.
<dl>
<dt>&quot;This command is not defined&quot;
<dd>Commands begin with a '.' in the first column of a row of text.&nbsp; You probably have a line beginning with a period.
<dt><br>&quot;This tag is not defined&quot;

<dt><br>&quot;Attributes are not allowed for this tag--probably missing .&nbsp; to end the tag&quot;
<dd>This tag has no attributes.
<dt><br>&quot;The tag, word, or command is not allowed in this context&quot;
<dd>This is usually because the enclosing tag can only contain specific tags or no tags at all.
<dt><br>&quot;Syntax error in tag&quot;
<dd>There is something wrong within the tag.
<dt><br>&quot;Ignoring text before the h1 tag&quot;
<dd>Text and most tags cannot appear before the first heading tag.

<dd>Only Windows and OS/2 bmp files are supported by wipfc.
<dt><br>&quot;Cannot hide a header with the res attribute set&quot;
<dd>Either don't hide the header, or remove the res attribute so it can't be a link target.
<dt><br>&quot;No valid cols have been specified&quot;
<dd>A table needs its column widths specified in advance.
<dt><br>&quot;The total width of the table is &gt;250 characters&quot;
<dd>The total width of a table (including borders) cannot exceed 250 characters.
<dt><br>&quot;Ignoring text before c tag&quot;
<dd>Text in a table must be inside of a cell.&nbsp; Put it after the c tag.
<dt><br>&quot;Ignoring invalid tag in table cell&quot;
<dd>Table cells cannot contain other block-level tags.

<dt><br>&quot;Ignoring extra table columns in this row&quot;
<dd>You have more c tags in the row than you have columns specified in the table tag.
<dt><br>&quot;Not enough columns have been specified for this row&quot;
<dd>You have fewer c tags in the row than you have columns specified in the table tag.
<dt><br>&quot;The required elink tag is missing, but has been appended to this column&quot;

<dd>A required attribute is either missing, or has an invalid value.
<dt><br>&quot;Invalid symbol (entity reference or .nameit expansion)&quot;
<dd>The entity reference or nameit macro is not defined.&nbsp; Check the spelling.

<dt><br>&quot;Footnote cannot be indexed&quot;
<dd>Footnotes cannot have in1, in2, or icmd tags.
<dt><br>&quot;Too many (&gt; 14) fonts have been used&quot;
<dd>You need to user fewer fonts.
<dt><br>&quot;Title or index text is too long&quot;
<dd>The length of title text is limited to 47 characters; index text, to 255 characters.
<dt><br>&quot;Subindexes of a global index must be global, too&quot;
<dd>If an index is global, all of its subindexes must be global, too.&nbsp; Set the 'global' flag.
<dt><br>&quot;An index entry requires text&quot;
<dd>Text must follow an in1, in2, or icmd tag.

<dd>Footnotes are special.
<dt><br>&quot;Missing res number in a .HLP file&quot;
<dd>HLP files headers are required have res numbers.&nbsp; INF files are not unless they are being concatenated.&nbsp; HLP files
 appear to work fine without them as long as they aren't concatenated and don't use global links.
</dl>
<h1 id="IPF_Symbols"> IPF Symbols </h1>
<br>Special symbols can be incorporated into OS/2 help file by using entity references in the form of &amp;symbol-name.&nbsp;
 Each entity reference begins with the '&amp;' character and ends with the '.' character.&nbsp; New symbols can be created
 by using the nameit command (see <a href="#nameit">nameit</a>), but each language encoding has a pre-defined set of symbols
 associated with it.&nbsp; For the en_US locale (and other locales using the IBM 850 code page), the predefined symbols are
 as follows (symbols that cannot appear in this document are left blank):
