<h1 id="PowerPP_Linker_Diagnostic_Messages"> Power++ Linker Diagnostic Messages </h1>
<br>The Power++ Linker issues three classes of messages; fatal errors, errors and warnings.&nbsp; Each message has a 4-digit
 number associated with it.&nbsp; Fatal messages start with the digit 3, error messages start with the digit 2, and warning
 messages start with the digit 1.&nbsp; It is possible for a message to be issued as a warning or an error.
<br><br>If a fatal error occurs, the linker will terminate immediately and no executable file will be generated.
<br><br>If an error occurs, the linker will continue to execute so that all possible errors are issued.&nbsp; However, no
 executable file will be generated since these errors do not permit a proper executable file to be generated.
<br><br>If a warning occurs, the linker will continue to execute.&nbsp; A warning message is usually informational and does
 not prevent the creation of a proper executable file.&nbsp; However, all warnings should eventually be corrected.
<br><br>The messages listed contain references to<tt> %s, %S, %a, %x, %d, %l,</tt> and<tt> %f.</tt>&nbsp; They represent strings
 that are substituted by the Power++ Linker to make the error message more precise.
<ol>
<li><tt> %s</tt> represents a string.&nbsp; This may be a segment or group name, or the name of a linker directive or option.
<li><tt> %S</tt> represents the name of a symbol.
<li><tt> %a</tt> represents an address.&nbsp; The format of the address depends on the format of the executable file being
 generated.
<li><tt> %x</tt> represents a hexadecimal number.
<li><tt> %d</tt> represents integers in the range -32768 and 32767.
<li><tt> %l</tt> represents integers in the range -2147483648 and 2147483647.
<li><tt> %f</tt> represents an executable file format such as DOS, ZDOS, WINDOWS, PHARLAP, NOVELL, OS2, QNX or ELF.
</ol>
<br>The following is a list of all warning and error messages produced by the Power++ Linker followed by a description of
 the message.&nbsp; A message may contain more than one reference to &quot;%s&quot;.&nbsp; In such a case, the description
 will reference them as &quot;%sn&quot; where n is the occurrence of &quot;%s&quot; in the message.
<h2 id="2002_TT_internal_TT_M__s"> 2002 ** internal ** - %s </h2>
<br>If this message occurs, you have found a bug in the linker and should report it.
<h2 id="2008_cannot_open__s1____s2"> 2008 cannot open %s1 :&nbsp; %s2 </h2>
<br>An error occurred while trying to open the file &quot;%s1&quot;.&nbsp; The reason for the error is given by &quot;%s2&quot;.
&nbsp; Generally this error message is issued when the linker cannot open a file (e.g., an object file or an executable file).
<h2 id="3009_dynamic_memory_exhausted"> 3009 dynamic memory exhausted </h2>
<br>The linker uses all available memory when linking an application.&nbsp; For DOS-hosted versions of the linker, this includes
 expanded memory (EMS) and extended memory.&nbsp; When all available memory is used, a spill file will be used.&nbsp; Therefore,
 unless you are low on disk space, the linker will always be able to generate the executable file.
<h2 id="2010_3010_IDO_error_processing__s1____s2"> 2010,3010 I/O error processing %s1 :&nbsp; %s2 </h2>
<br>An error has occurred while processing the file &quot;%s1&quot;.&nbsp; The cause of the error is given by &quot;%s2&quot;.
&nbsp; This error is usually detected while reading from object and library files or writing to the spill file or executable
 file.&nbsp; For example, this error would be issued if a &quot;disk full&quot; condition existed.
<h2 id="2011_invalid_object_file_attribute"> 2011 invalid object file attribute </h2>
<br>The linker encountered an object file that was not of the format required of an object file.
<h2 id="2012_invalid_library_file_attribute"> 2012 invalid library file attribute </h2>
<br>The linker encountered a library file that was not of the format required of a library file.
<h2 id="3013_break_key_detected"> 3013 break key detected </h2>
<br>The linking process was interrupted by the user from the keyboard.
<h2 id="1014_stack_segment_not_found"> 1014 stack segment not found </h2>
<br>The linker identifies the stack segment by a segment defined as having the &quot;STACK&quot; attribute.&nbsp; This message
 is issued if no such segment is encountered.&nbsp; This usually happens if the linker cannot find the run-time libraries
 required to link your application.
<h2 id="2015_bad_relocation_type_specified"> 2015 bad relocation type specified </h2>
<br>This message is issued if a a relocation is found in an object file which the linker does not support.
<h2 id="2016__a__absolute_target_invalid_for_selfMrelative_relocation"> 2016 %a:&nbsp; absolute target invalid for self-relative relocation </h2>
<br>This message is issued, for example, if a near call or jump is made to an external symbol which is defined using the &quot;EQU&quot;
 assembler directive.&nbsp; &quot;%a&quot; identifies the location of the near call or jump instruction.
<h2 id="2017_bad_location_specified_for_selfMrelative_relocation_at__a"> 2017 bad location specified for self-relative relocation at %a </h2>
<br>This message is issued if a bad fixup is encountered.&nbsp; &quot;%a&quot; defines the location of the fixup.
<h2 id="2018_relocation_offset_at__a_is_out_of_range"> 2018 relocation offset at %a is out of range </h2>
<br>This message is issued when the offset part of a relocation exceeds 64K in a 16-bit executable or an Alpha executable.
&nbsp; &quot;%a&quot; defines the location of the fixup.&nbsp; The error is most commonly caused by errors in coding assembly
 language routines.&nbsp; Consider a module that references an external symbol that is defined in a segment different from
 the one in which the reference occurred.&nbsp; The module, however, specifies that the segment in which the symbol is defined
 is the same segment as the segment that references the symbol.&nbsp; This error is most commonly caused when the &quot;EXTRN&quot;
 assembler directive is placed after the &quot;SEGMENT&quot; assembler directive for the segment referencing the symbol.&nbsp;
 If the segment that references the symbol is allocated far enough away from the segment that defines the symbol, the linker
 will issue this message.
<br><br>This message should not be issued for a Power++ Win32 executable.&nbsp; If it is issued, please report this problem.
<h2 id="1019_segment_relocation_at__a"> 1019 segment relocation at %a </h2>
<br>This message is issued when a 16-bit segment relocation is encountered and &quot;FORMAT DOS COM&quot;, &quot;FORMAT PHARLAP&quot;

 error is to specify a &quot;DEBUG&quot; directive after the &quot;FILE&quot; directives in which case no debugging information
 for those object files is generated in the executable file.
<br><br>This message should not be issued when using Power++.&nbsp; If it is issued, please report this problem.
<h2 id="2039_ALIGNMENT_value_too_small"> 2039 ALIGNMENT value too small </h2>
<br>The value specified in the &quot;ALIGNMENT&quot; option refers to the alignment of segments in the executable file.&nbsp;
 For 16-bit Windows or 16-bit OS/2, segments in the executable file are pointed to by a segment table.&nbsp; An entry in the
 segment table contains a 16-bit value which is a multiple of the alignment value.&nbsp; Together they form the offset of
 the segment from the start of the segment table.&nbsp; The smaller the alignment, the bigger the value required in the segment
 table to point to the segment.&nbsp; If this value exceeds 64K, then a larger alignment value is required to decrease the
 size that goes in the segment table.
