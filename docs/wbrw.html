<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Browser"> The Open Watcom Browser </h1>
<br>Imagine being assigned to a project with thousands of lines of C++ source code.&nbsp; Learning the relationship between
 the objects of such an application can be very difficult.&nbsp; The Browser was developed to solve this very problem - to
 help developers better understand the source code they are working with.&nbsp; Information such as the class inheritance
 hierarchy and the call tree for an application can be studied while using the Browser.&nbsp; Once you have located a symbol,
 you can quickly view the source file that contains its definition or list all the files that reference it.&nbsp; Viewing
 these relationships helps you understand how the program works.
<br><br>This chapter describes the many tasks you can perform with the Browser, including creating and opening a Browser database
 file, configuring the Browser session, and viewing the list of all symbols in your program, the class inheritance hierarchy,
 and call structure.
<h2 id="Using_the_Browser"> Using the Browser </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Starting the Browser
<li>Starting the Browser through the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment
<li>Quitting the Browser
<li>The Browser Menu Bar
</ul>
<h3 id="Starting_the_Browser"> Starting the Browser </h3>
<br>To start the Browser, double click on the Browser icon.&nbsp; This opens the Browser window.&nbsp; The caption bar of
 this window displays the current option file and Browser database file.&nbsp; The message<tt> no browser file</tt> appears
 on this line if a database file is not currently selected.
<br><br>The Browser is an integrated tool that you can open from the IDE so that you can browse the source code of the project
 you are working on.&nbsp; Refer to the IDE guide for further information on the Integrated Development Environment.
<h3 id="Quitting_the_Browser"> Quitting the Browser </h3>
<br>To exit the Browser, choose<b> Exit</b> from the<b> File</b> menu of the Browser window.&nbsp; If you made changes to
 the options during the Browser session, a message box appears prompting you to save the changes.
<br><br>Choose<b> No</b> in the message box to close the Browser session without saving.&nbsp; Any options changed within
 the session are lost.
<br><br>Choose<b> Yes</b> in the message box to save the current options to the current option file, if one exists, and exit
 the Browser session.&nbsp; If no option file exists, a<b> Save As</b> dialog appears that allows you to specify the option
 file to which you want to save the new options.
<dl>
<dt>
<dd><b> Select</b><b> Cancel</b> to return to the main Browser window without saving the options.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select</b><b> OK</b> to close the dialog and exit the Browser session.
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Browser_Menu_Bar"> The Browser Menu Bar </h3>
<br>The Browser's menu bar consists of the following eight menus:
<dl>
<dt>File
<dd>Create, open, and configure Browser files; save and load options
<dt><br>View
<dd>Choose a global view for the current database file
<dt><br>Detail
<dd>View detailed information for a symbol
<dt><br>Tree
<dd>Choose the nodes to display for a tree view
<dt><br>Locate
<dd>Find symbols within the current global view
<dt><br>Options
<dd>Configure the Browser session
<dt><br>Windows
<dd>Select from the list of Browser windows currently open
<dt><br>Help
<dd>Access on-line help information
</dl>
<h2 id="Browser_Files"> Browser Files </h2>
<br>To browse your source code, you must first create a Browser module file for each source file that you wish to browse.
&nbsp; Currently, browsing is supported by the Open Watcom C/C++ compilers only (Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 does not support browsing).
&nbsp; To create a Browser module file, specify the &quot;db&quot; option when you compile the source file.&nbsp; If you are
 using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, select<b> Emit Browser Information</b> from the<b> Debugging Switches</b>
 panel of the<b> Compiler Switches</b> dialog.&nbsp; The Browser module file will have the same name as the source file and
 an extension of &quot;.MBR&quot;.
<br><br>Once the Browser module files have been created, these files are merged and a Browser database file is created.&nbsp;
 This process eliminates redundant information such as duplicate definitions that occur when a header file is included by
 many source files.&nbsp; Browser database files have the extension &quot;.DBR&quot;.
<br><br>The Browser allows you to configure your session and saves this configuration to an options file.&nbsp; Options files
 have the extension &quot;.OBR&quot;.&nbsp; The file name<tt> setup.obr</tt> is the default name of the options file.&nbsp;
 The default options file is automatically loaded by the Browser when the Browser is started.
<h3 id="Creating_a_Browser_Database_File_within_the_Browser"> Creating a Browser Database File within the Browser </h3>
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose</b><b> New</b> from the<b> File</b> menu.
<br>This opens the<b> New Browser File</b> dialog where you enter the name of the Browser database file you are creating.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow1.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 1.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Use the New Browser File dialog to create a new Browser database file.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Type the name and path</b> of the new Browser database file.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Click on the</b><b> Files</b> button to open a second dialog that allows you to browse the directory structure for an
 existing Browser database file.&nbsp; Select an existing file and change its name.&nbsp; If you do not change its name, a
 message box appears when you press<b> OK</b> asking if you want to overwrite the existing file.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on</b><b> OK.</b>
<br>This opens a<b> Module</b> window that will eventually contain a list of the module files that will make up the database
 file.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on the</b><b> Add</b> button in the<b> Module</b> window.
<br>This opens the<b> Select Module File(s)</b> dialog where you choose the module files to add to the database file.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Select the module files</b> to add to the database file and click on<b> OK.</b>
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Double click</b> on the desired module file.
<br>This closes the<b> Select Module File(s)</b> dialog and adds the selected module file to the Browser file component list.
&nbsp; Each module file on the components list has a check box.&nbsp; When added, this check box is marked with an X, indicating
 that the module file is enabled.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Continue with steps 4 and 5</b> until you have added all desired module files to the component list.
<br><tt><img src="brow2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 2.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Modules dialog displays the selected module files.</b>
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Click on</b><b> OK</b> on the<b> Module</b> window.
<br>This closes the<b> Module</b> window and creates the database file.
</dl>
<h3 id="Creating_a_Browser_Database_File_from_the_Command_Line"> Creating a Browser Database File from the Command Line </h3>
<br>It is also possible to create the Browser database file from the command line.&nbsp; This allows you to make Browser database
 file creation part of your standard build procedure.&nbsp; When you do this, the batch build procedure will automatically
 update your database file.&nbsp; Updating the Browser database file occurs only if changes have been made to a module file
 within the database file.
<br><br>A separate utility, called the merger, is used to create the database file.&nbsp; The name of the merger program is<tt>
 wbrg.exe.</tt>&nbsp; Its command line consists of the name of the database file and a list of the module files (.MBR files)
 to be merged.&nbsp; The name of the database file must be preceded by a<tt> database</tt> command.&nbsp; The default extension
 given to the database file is &quot;.DBR&quot;.&nbsp; The list of module files must be preceded by a<tt> file</tt> command.
&nbsp; The module file names must be separated by commas or enclosed by curly braces and separated by spaces.&nbsp; The list
 of module file names can contain wild cards.&nbsp; The following are examples of valid merger commands.&nbsp; In each case,
 the module files<tt> m1.mbr</tt> and<tt> m2.mbr</tt> will be processed and the database file<tt> db.dbr</tt> will be created.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg database db file m1, m2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg database db file { m1 m2 }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg file m1, m2 database db</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg file { m1 m2 } database db</tt>
<br><br>It is also possible to specify a command file that contains merger commands.&nbsp; Command files have the extension
 &quot;.CBR&quot;.&nbsp; Consider a command file, called<tt> merge.cbr,</tt> containing the following merger commands.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database db</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file m1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file m2</tt>
<br><br>The following example will achieve the same results as the previous example.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg @merge</tt>
<br><br>If you want to suppress the listing of file names that the merger produces as it is working, you can include the &quot;quiet&quot;
 option on the command line or in the command file.
<h3 id="Opening_an_Existing_Browser_Database_File"> Opening an Existing Browser Database File </h3>
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose</b><b> Open</b> from the<b> File</b> menu.
<br>This opens the<b> Open Browser Database File</b> dialog where you select the database file you want to open.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select a database file to open and click on</b><b> OK.</b>
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Double click</b> on the desired database file.
<br>This closes the<b> Open Browser Database File</b> dialog.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>You can have only one database file open at a time.&nbsp; If you open a second database file, the Browser discards the first
 and displays information for the second.
</dl>
</dl>
<h3 id="Working_with_Browser_Module_Files"> Working with Browser Module Files </h3>
<br>Once a Browser database file is loaded, you might want to edit the list of modules originally used to create the database
 file.&nbsp; Editing the list of modules allows you to temporarily remove modules from the database or add modules to the
 database.&nbsp; For example, you may decide that you only want to browse a particular module or set of modules or you may
 have forgotten a module when the database was originally created.
<br><br>The<b> Modules</b> menu item in the<b> File</b> menu allows you to view the list of module files that make up the
 current database file.&nbsp; From this list you can perform the following functions on the module files:
<ul>
<li>Add
<li>Remove
<li>Disable
<li>Enable
</ul>
<br><tt><img src="brow3.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

<h2 id="Global_Views"> Global Views </h2>
<br>The menu items under the View menu let you display a global view of your program.&nbsp; A global view is one that displays
 relationships between all symbols in your program.&nbsp; The following are global views.
<dl>
<dt>List
<dd>Displays a list of all symbols in your program
<dt><br>Inheritance
<dd>Displays the class inheritance graph for your program
<dt><br>Call
<dd>Displays the call graph for your program
</dl>
<br>Once a global view has been displayed, you can view detailed information for the symbols in the global view.&nbsp; Refer
 to the section entitled <a href="#Viewing_Detail_Information">Viewing Detail Information</a> for a discussion on displaying
 detail information.
<br><br>It is possible to specify a query that restricts the symbols displayed in global views.&nbsp; See the section entitled
 <a href="#Global_Symbol_Queries">Global Symbol Queries</a> for more information.
<h3 id="The_List_View"> The List View </h3>
<br>Using the Browser to view the symbols in your program is much faster than searching through your source code for symbol
 information.&nbsp; From the symbols list you can quickly access detailed information on a symbol that tells you where the
 symbol is used and where it is defined.
<br><br>To view a list of all symbols in the current Browser database file, choose<b> List</b> from the<b> View</b> menu.
&nbsp; This displays a window which can list all symbols in your program.&nbsp; The window has a vertical scroll bar that
 allows you to scroll through the list of symbols in your program.&nbsp; Since your program may contain a very large number
 of symbols, the Browser does not load all the symbols in your program from the database.&nbsp; Instead, only the number of
 symbols that can be displayed in the window are loaded.&nbsp; As far as the Browser is concerned, this list is infinite.
&nbsp; For this reason, the scroll thumb on the vertical scroll bar is positioned in the middle of the vertical scroll bar
 and cannot be moved.&nbsp; Click below the vertical scroll thumb to view the next page of symbols and above the vertical
 scroll thumb to view the previous page of symbols.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow4.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 4.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The List window displays all symbols in the current browser database file.</b>
<br><br>Each symbol has a icon to its left.&nbsp; A letter marking each icon indicates the symbol type in the source code
 as follows:
<dl>
<dt>F
<dd>Function
<dt><br>C
<dd>Class
<dt><br>T
<dd>Typedef
<dt><br>V
<dd>Variable
<dt><br>E
<dd>Enum
</dl>
<br>There are several ways to display the detail view of symbols.&nbsp; When you reveal the detail view, the file folder icon
 changes to an open file folder.&nbsp; To close the detail view dialog, click on the file folder.&nbsp; This changes the icon
 back to a closed folder and closes the dialog.&nbsp; To reveal the detail view of a symbol you can perform any of the following
 actions:
<ul>
<li>The file folder icons are hot spots that display the detail view of the selected symbol.&nbsp; To activate the hot spot,
 click once on the symbol name to select it and press ENTER to reveal the detail view.
<li>Click once on the file folder to reveal the detail view for that symbol.
<li>Click once on the symbol name to select it and choose<b> Detail</b> from the<b> Detail</b> menu.
<li>Double click on the symbol name.
</ul>
<h3 id="The_Class_Inheritance_View"> The Class Inheritance View </h3>
<br>Selecting<b> Inheritance</b> from the<b> View</b> menu displays the inheritance hierarchy of all of the C++ classes in
 your program using a tree.&nbsp; This allows you to see the relationships between base classes and derived classes.&nbsp;
 In the inheritance hierarchy, each node represents a class.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 5.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Inheritance view displays the hierarchy of all C++ classes in your program
 (graph view shown).</b>
<br><br>There are two different tree views you can choose from to display the class hierarchy:
<dl>
<dt>Graph view
<dd>The graph view displays each class in a box.&nbsp; A box, or node, is connected to another node if one is a derived class
 of the other.&nbsp; The root node of the tree is the base class for all nodes in the tree.&nbsp; The tree is initially fully
 expanded.&nbsp; See the section entitled <a href="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</a> for more
 information on removing and expanding nodes from the tree.
<dt><br>Outline view
<dd>The outline view displays the same information as the graph view but in a different way.&nbsp; The outline view is initially
 fully collapsed.&nbsp; That is, only the base classes are displayed.&nbsp; In order to view the derived classes of a node,
 you must single click on the node.&nbsp; This expands the node, displaying all its immediate derived classes.&nbsp; See the
 section entitled <a href="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</a> for more information on removing
 and expanding nodes from the tree.
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Function_Call_Tree_View"> The Function Call Tree View </h3>
<br>Selecting<b> Call</b> from the<b> View</b> menu displays the function call tree for all functions in your program.&nbsp;
 This allows you to see all the functions that a given function calls and conversely all functions that call a certain function.
&nbsp; In the call tree, each node represents a function.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow6.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 6.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Call view displays a call tree for all functions in your program (outline
 view shown).</b>
<br><br>There are two different tree views you can choose from to display the function call tree:
<dl>
<dt>Graph view
<dd>The graph view displays each function in a box.&nbsp; A box, or node, is connected to another node if one function calls the
 other.&nbsp; The tree is initially fully expanded.&nbsp; See the section entitled <a href="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</a>
 for more information on removing and expanding nodes from the tree.
<dt><br>Outline view
<dd>The outline view displays the same information as the graph view but in a different way.&nbsp; The outline view is initially
 fully collapsed.&nbsp; In order to view the functions called by the function specified in the node, you must single click
 on the node.&nbsp; This expands the node, displaying all functions it calls.&nbsp; See the section entitled <a href="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</a>
 for more information on removing and expanding nodes from the tree.
</dl>
<h3 id="Manipulating_the_Tree_Views"> Manipulating the Tree Views </h3>
<br>With both the graph view and the outline view you can change the information displayed in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>select the root nodes you want to view
<li>expand any node in the view
<li>collapse any node in the view
</ul>
<br>You expand and collapse nodes in the graph and outline views to hide and reveal descendant and ancestor nodes of the selected
 node.&nbsp; There are two ways to expand and collapse nodes:
<ul>
<li>choose the desired function from the<b> Tree</b> menu
<li>click on the node (applies only to the outline view)
</ul>
<br>In addition to these functions, you can force the graph to be redrawn when a node in the tree view is collapsed.&nbsp;
 By default, collapsed nodes will leave a gap in the graph.&nbsp; Redrawing the graph removes these gaps.&nbsp; This feature
 is controlled by an option.&nbsp; See the section entitled <a href="#Configuring_the_Browser">Configuring the Browser</a>
 for more information.
<br><br>Clicking on the right mouse button when the mouse cursor is in a tree view will automatically display the<b> Tree</b>
 menu.&nbsp; This allows you to perform the actions in the<b> Tree</b> menu without actually going to the menu bar.
<h4 id="Selecting_Root_Nodes"> Selecting Root Nodes </h4>
<br>Select<b> Select Root Nodes</b> from the<b> Tree</b> menu to change the root nodes that are displayed.&nbsp; The root
 nodes you select appear in the graph or outline view; all other root nodes are hidden.
<br><br>Choosing<b> Select Root Nodes</b> from the<b> Tree</b> menu opens the<b> Select Root Nodes</b> dialog.&nbsp; This
 dialog lists all of the symbols that appear as a root node.&nbsp; Each symbol in the<b> Select Root Nodes</b> dialog has
 a check box.&nbsp; When enabled, this check box is marked with an X, indicating that the symbol will appear as a root node
 in the display.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow7.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

 view to locate a particular symbol.&nbsp; There are two functions that can help you locate a symbol in a global view:
<ul>
<li>Find
<li>Find Selected
</ul>
<h3 id="Find"> Find </h3>
<br>Choose<b> Find</b> from the<b> Locate</b> menu to open the<b> Find</b> dialog.&nbsp; Use this dialog to specify the criteria
 to be used to locate a symbol.&nbsp; For example, you can search for a particular symbol or a set of symbols with common
 characteristics.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 11.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Use the Find dialog to locate one symbol or a set of symbols.</b>
<h4 id="Find_Pattern"> Find Pattern </h4>

 matching behaviour depends on the switches set in this dialog.
<dl>
<dt>Match Case
<dd>When enabled, the Browser performs a case sensitive compare when attempting to find a match.
<dt><br>Match Whole Symbols Only
<dd>When enabled, the Browser locates symbols that exactly match the specified pattern.&nbsp; This switch only applies when the<b>
 Use Regular Expressions</b> switch is disabled.
<dt><br>Use Regular Expressions
<dd>When enabled, the Browser interprets the pattern specified as a regular expression.&nbsp; The<b> Edit</b> button, when pressed,
 displays the<b> Regular Expression Options</b> dialog.&nbsp; This dialog allows you to specify the regular expression.
</dl>
<br>Dropping the combo box of the<b> Pattern</b> field displays a list of previous patterns entered.&nbsp; You can select
 a pattern from this list instead of entering a new one.
<h4 id="Find_Filters"> Find Filters </h4>
<br>Clicking on the<b> Filters</b> button on the<b> Find</b> dialog opens the<b> Find Filters</b> dialog.&nbsp; This dialog
 allows you to specify the characteristics of the symbol(s) to be located.

</dl>
<br></tt><b>Find File Filters</b></tt>
<br>The<b> Source Files</b> button, when pressed, displays the<b> Source Files</b> dialog that allows you to specify the files
 to be searched when attempting to locate a symbol.&nbsp; This dialog lists all source files that make up the database file.
&nbsp; Each source file in the list has a check box.&nbsp; An X in this box indicates that the source file is searched when
 trying to locate a symbol.&nbsp; Click in the check box of the source file you want to disable.&nbsp; This removes the X.
&nbsp; The blank box indicates that the source file will not be searched when trying to locate a symbol.&nbsp; To re-enable
 the source file, click in the check box again.&nbsp; This places an X in the box indicating that the source file will be
 searched.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow13.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

<br><br>The<b> Pattern</b> section of the dialog, allows you to specify wild card directory specifications for files that
 are to be included or excluded in the search.&nbsp; For example, specifying &quot;d:\watcom\h\*.h&quot; and pressing the<b>
 Exclude</b> button, will prevent any file in the &quot;d:\watcom\h&quot; directory with extension &quot;.h&quot; from being
 searched.&nbsp; To include these files in the search again, specify the same pattern and press the<b> Include</b> button.
<br><br>Pressing the<b> Set All</b> button includes all files in the search.
<br><br>Pressing the<b> Clear All</b> button excludes all files in the search.&nbsp; This is useful, for example, if you wish

 the Pattern section, and press the<b> Include</b> button.
<h4 id="Performing_the_Find"> Performing the Find </h4>
<br>Once the filter criteria are set, perform the find operation by clicking on the<b> OK</b> button on the<b> Find</b> dialog.
&nbsp; This closes the dialog and performs the search.&nbsp; The Browser examines the symbols in the current global view and
 selects the first symbol that matches the search criteria.
<br><br>To find the next symbol that matches the search criteria, choose<b> Find Next</b> from the<b> Locate</b> menu.
<h3 id="Find_Selected"> Find Selected </h3>
<br>Because the symbols displayed in a global view are often many, only a portion of the display is visible in the window
 at any time.&nbsp; When you temporarily scroll away from the selected symbol or node, a quick method of locating that symbol
 is to select<b> Find Selected</b> from the<b> Locate</b> menu.&nbsp; This will immediately locate and display the currently
 selected symbol in the global view.

 to the editor whenever it is started by the Browser.&nbsp; The argument line can include any of three different macros which
 will be filled in by the Browser.&nbsp; The macros are:
<dl>
<dt>%f
<dd>The name of the file to be edited.
<dt><br>%r
<dd>The row in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a line number then the row value is extracted from the message; otherwise the row value is 1.
<dt><br>%c
<dd>The column in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a column number then the column value is extracted from the message; otherwise the column value is 1.
</dl>
<br>For example, if the editor argument line that you specified was:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='%f' row='%r' col='%c'</tt>
<br><br>and you double click on an error message in the Log window that names the file<tt> foobar.c</tt> with an error at
 line 215 and column 31, then the argument line that is passed to your editor is:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='foobar.c' row='215' col='31'</tt>
<br><br>This flexibility allows you to specify the name of the file to edit and the row and/or column at which to position
 the text cursor.&nbsp; If no row or column is available, then the Browser will supply the value of 1 as a default.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select OK</b> when you wish to confirm the selection of a new editor.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select Cancel</b> when you wish to cancel the selection of a new editor.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select Default</b> when you wish to restore the default editor selection and then select OK or Cancel.

<h3 id="Automatically_Saving_Options_on_Exit"> Automatically Saving Options on Exit </h3>
<br><b> Save Options on Exit</b> in the<b> Options</b> menu instructs the Browser to automatically save the current options
 to an options file.&nbsp; To enable the automatic saving of options, select<b> Save Options on Exit</b> from the<b> Options</b>
 menu.&nbsp; A check mark beside the menu item indicates that it is enabled.&nbsp; To disable this option, select it again.
<br><br>See the section entitled <a href="#Saving_Options">Saving Options</a> for more information on saving options to a
 file.
<h2 id="Loading_Options"> Loading Options </h2>
<br>Use the<b> Load Options</b> menu to load an option file into your Browser session.
<br><br>Choose<b> Load Options</b> from the<b> File menu.</b>&nbsp; The<b> Load Options File</b> dialog appears where you
 select the option file you want to load for the current Browser session.
<h2 id="Saving_Options"> Saving Options </h2>
<br>There are three ways to save the current options to an option file:
<ul>
<li>Save Options
<li>Save Options As
<li>Save Options on Exit
</ul>
<br>An asterisk beside the option file name in the caption bar indicates that changes were made to the options during the
 Browser session and should be saved.&nbsp; This section describes each method for saving options to a file.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If you have made option changes during the Browser session and you choose<b> Exit</b> from the<b> File</b> menu without first
 saving the options, the Browser prompts you to save the options to a file.&nbsp; Refer to the section entitled <a href="#Quitting_the_Browser">Quitting the Browser</a>
 for more information.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Save Options
<dd>Selecting<b> Save Options</b> from the<b> File</b> menu saves the updated options information to the current options file.
&nbsp; To save options in this way, an options file must be specified in the caption bar.&nbsp; 
<dt><br>Save Options As
<dd><b> Save Options As</b> in the<b> File</b> menu opens the<b> Save Options As</b> dialog.&nbsp; Specify the filename of the
 option file to which you want to save the current options.&nbsp; Click on<b> OK</b> to close the dialog and save the options.
<dt><br>Save Options on Exit
<dd><b> Save Options on Exit</b> in the<b> Options</b> menu allows you to specify that the Browser is to automatically save the
 current options to an options file, if one exists.&nbsp; When enabled, a check mark appears beside this menu item.
<br>When enabled and an option file exists, the Browser saves the changes without prompting when you close the session.
<br><br>When enabled and no option file exists, the Browser displays a message box prompting you to save the new options.
&nbsp; Choose<b> No</b> in this box to close the Browser session without saving.&nbsp; Choose<b> Yes</b> in this box to display
 a<b> Save As</b> dialog where you specify the option file to which you want to save the new options.
</dl>
<h2 id="Setting_Source_Search_Paths"> Setting Source Search Paths </h2>
<br>You can specify a command line option to the Browser that allows you to specify alternate source file search paths.&nbsp;
 This option is useful when a database file is created on a system different from the one that is used to browse the application
 source code.&nbsp; The syntax of the command line option is:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path path_spec1;path_spec2;...</tt>
<br><br>Since the database files record explicit paths to source files, it is likely that the path will no longer be valid
 once the software is moved to another system.
<br><br>When the Browser cannot locate the specified file using its explicit path, it will search the paths listed in the
 path option.
