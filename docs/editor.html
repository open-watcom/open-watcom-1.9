<br><br>The settings are divided into five categories:
<ul>
<li>Source
<li>Language
<li>Tabs
<li>Tags
<li>Miscellaneous
</ul>
<h4 id="File_Specific_Options___Source"> File Specific Options :&nbsp; Source </h4>
<br>The source section contains a number of options that allow you to control your source code.
<dl>
<dt>Read entire file
<dd>Turn this on if you want the Editor to read the entire file when it opens a new file.&nbsp; Turn this option off if you want
 the Editor to load small pieces of the file as needed.
<dt><br>Check read-only flag
<dd>Turn this option on if you want files that you open to be read only.&nbsp; You cannot change or write the files under the
 same name.
<dt><br>Ignore Ctrl-Z
<dd>Turn this option on if you want the Editor to ignore Ctrl-Z as the end of file marker.
<dt><br>CRLF Autodetect
<dd>Turn this option on if you want the Editor to detect if the file it is opening has CR and LF at the end of each line.&nbsp;
 If it does, it will write the file in the same format.
<dt><br>Write CRLFs
<dd>Turn this option on if you want both a CR and an LF at the end of each line.&nbsp; This is the standard format for DOS files.
<dt><br>Use eight-bit characters
<dd>Turn this option on if you want to edit the IBM extended characters, such as line drawing.&nbsp; If this option is off, you
 can edit normal text only.
</dl>
<h4 id="File_Specific_Options___Language"> File Specific Options :&nbsp; Language </h4>
<br>The Editor allows you to highlight different parts of the syntax for the language you are using.&nbsp; This allows you
 to easily find the parts of code you are looking for because they are different colors and/or fonts.&nbsp; The Editor highlights
 lexical elements for C, C++, Fortran, Java and JavaScript, and HTML code (among others).
<br><br>The Language section also allows you to turn on C Indent Assist.&nbsp; The Editor then uses common C formatting conventions
 such as smart indenting and outdenting with braces.
<h4 id="File_Specific_Options___Tabs"> File Specific Options :&nbsp; Tabs </h4>
<br>Use the tab options to define what the tab key does and the tab amounts.
<dl>
<dt>Tab amount
<dd>Set the tab width if real tabs has not been set.&nbsp; Tab amount specifies the number of spaces indented by tab key.
<dt><br>Shiftwidth
<dd>Set the shiftwidth value.&nbsp; The default is four characters.
<dt><br>Real Tabs
<dd>Turn Real Tabs on to use the ASCII tab character instead of spaces when you press TAB.&nbsp; Turn this option off to have
 tabs replaced with the appropriate number of spaces.
<dt><br>Hard Tabs
<dd>Set the width of hard tabs.&nbsp; The default is eight characters.
<dt><br>Autoindent
<dd>Turn on the Autoindent feature.&nbsp; Each new line then indents to the same level as the previous line.
</dl>
<h4 id="File_Specific_Options___Tags"> File Specific Options :&nbsp; Tags </h4>
<br>Use the Tags options to control the file that contains the list of code items in your source files.
<dl>
<dt>Tag File
<dd>Enter the name of the tag file that contains your ctags.
<dt><br>Ignore Case
<dd>Turn this option on, if you want the tag file to ignore the case of tags.
<dt><br>Prompt on multiple tags
<dd>Turn this option on, if you want to be prompted when you tag a function that has multiple entries in the tags file.
</dl>
<br>Tag files are created by the CTAGS utility, which is described in the Open Watcom VI editor documentation.
<h4 id="File_Specific_Options___Miscellaneous"> File Specific Options :&nbsp; Miscellaneous </h4>
<br>Use the Miscellaneous options to define the default file extensions for Editor files and to show matching brackets.
<dl>
<dt>Grep extensions
<dd>Define the default file extension to grep when you choose fgrep from the right mouse button pop-up menu.
<dt><br>Show matching brackets
<dd>Turn this option on for the cursor to flash to the opening brace when you type the closing brace.&nbsp; 
</dl>
<h3 id="ScreenDWindow_Options"> Screen/Window Options </h3>
<br>Use the Screen and Window Options dialog to define how you move around your screen and what appears on it.
<br><br><tt><img src="vi12.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 13.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Screen/Window Options Dialog</b>
<h4 id="ScreenDWindow_Options___Editing"> Screen/Window Options :&nbsp; Editing </h4>
<br>The Editing section allows you to to define how the text moves around the screen.
<dl>
<dt>Jumpy Scrolling
<dd>Turn this option on to scroll two lines at a time instead of one.
<dt><br>Line-based Selection
<dd>Turn this option on to select a whole line no matter where you are in the line when you select more than one line.&nbsp; You
 can still however, select part of one line.&nbsp; If this option is off, you can select any part of the first and last line
 in the block of lines you select.
<dt><br>Paging
<dd>Enter the number of lines that you want to overlap when you use the Page Up and Page Down keys.
</dl>
<h4 id="ScreenDWindow_Options___Miscellaneous"> Screen/Window Options :&nbsp; Miscellaneous </h4>
<br>The Miscellaneous options allow you to set the following:
<ul>
<li>Enter your own string to appear at the end of the file.&nbsp; For example, you may want the word<b> END</b> to appear
 at the end of the file.
<li>Save the Editor's screen position when you exit the file.
<li>Clear messages after the next key is pressed instead of having them remain until the next error message occurs.
</ul>
<h3 id="Saving_the_Configuration"> Saving the Configuration </h3>
<br>The Save Configuration menu item will save your current configuration regardless of the status of the &quot;Save configuration
 on exit&quot; setting.&nbsp; The configuration information is saved to a<tt> weditor.ini</tt> file either in the user's home
 directory (on multi-user systems) or in the Windows system directory.
<h1 id="Regular_Expressions"> Regular Expressions </h1>
<br>Regular expressions are a powerful method of matching strings in your text.&nbsp; Commands that use regular expressions
 are:
<ul>
<li>forward slash (/) command mode key (search forwards)
<li>question mark (?) command mode key (search backwards)
<li>forward slash (/) command line address (search forwards)
<li>question mark (?) command line address (search backwards)
<li>substitute command line command
<li>global command line command
<li>egrep command line command
<li>match command line command
</ul>
<br>Different characters in a regular expression match different things.&nbsp; A list of all special (or &quot;magical&quot;)
 characters is:&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>A backslash (\) followed by a single character other than new line matches that character
<li>The caret (^) matches the beginning of a line
<li>The dollar sign ($) matches the end of a line
<li>The dot (.) matches any character
<li>A single character that does not have any other special meaning matches that character
<li>A string enclosed in brackets &#91;&#93; matches any single character from the string.&nbsp; Ranges of ASCII character
 codes may be abbreviated as in a &quot;a-z0-9&quot;.&nbsp; A &#93; may occur only as the first character of the string.&nbsp;
 You must place a literal - where it cannot be mistaken as a range indicator.&nbsp; If a caret (^) occurs as the first character
 inside the brackets, then any characters NOT in the string are matched
<li>A regular expression followed by an asterisk (*) matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the regular expression
<li>A regular expression followed by a plus sign (+) matches one or more matches of the regular expression
<li>A regular expression followed by a question mark (?) matches zero or one matches of the regular expression
<li>Two regular expressions concatenated match a match of the first followed by a match of the second
<li>Two regular expressions separated by an or bar (|) match either a match for the first or a match for the second
<li>A regular expression enclosed in parentheses matches a match for the regular expression
<li>The order of precedence of operators at the same parenthesis level is the following:&nbsp; {}, then *+?, then concatenation,
 then /.
<li>All regular expressions following an at sign (@) are treated as case sensitive
<li>All regular expressions following a tilde (~) are to be treated as case insensitive
<li>If an exclamation point (!) occurs as the first character in a regular expression, it causes the ignoring of the<b><i>
 magic</i></b> setting; that is, all magic characters are treated as magical.&nbsp; An exclamation point (!) is treated as
 a regular character if it occurs anywhere but at the very start of the regular expression.
</ul>
<br>If a regular expression could match two different parts of the line, it will match the earliest one.&nbsp; If both begin
 in the same place, but match different lengths, or match the same length in different ways, then the rules are more complicated.
<br><br>In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are considered from left to right, the possibilities for *, +,
 and ?&nbsp; are considered longest first, nested constructs are considered from the outermost in, and concatenated constructs
 are considered leftmost first.&nbsp; The match that is chosen is the one that uses the earliest possibility in the first
 choice that has to be made.&nbsp; If there is more than one choice, the next will be made in the same manner (earliest possibility)
 subject to the decision on the first choice.&nbsp; An so forth.
<br><br>For example, (ab|a)b*c could batch the string<b> abc</b> in one of two ways.&nbsp; The first choice is between<b>
 ab</b> and<b> a.</b>&nbsp; Since ab is earlier in the expression and does lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen.
&nbsp; Since the<b> b</b> is already spoken for, the<b> b*</b> must match its last possibility since it must respect the earlier
 choice.
<br><br>If there are no |'s present and only one *m, +, or ?, the net effect is that the longest possible match will be chosen.
&nbsp; So<b> ab</b> presented with xabbbby, will match<b> abbbbb.</b>&nbsp; Note that is<b> ab*</b> is tried against<b> xabyabbbz,</b>
 it will match<b> ab</b> just after<b> x,</b> due to the begins earliest rule.
<h2 id="Regular_Expression_BNF"> Regular Expression BNF </h2>
<br>A pseudo-BNF for regular expressions is:
<dl>
<dt>reg-exp
<dd>{branch}|{branch}|...
<dt><br>branch
<dd>{piece}{piece}...
<dt><br>piece
<dd>{atom{* or + or ?}}{atom {* or + or ?}}...&nbsp; *-match 0 or more of the atom; +-match 1 or more of the atom; ?-match a match
 of the atom, or the null string.
<dt><br>atom
<dd>(reg-exp) or range or @ or ^ or $ or \char or char.
<dt><br>range
<dd>&#91;{^} char and/or charlo-charhi&#93;.&nbsp; ^ causes negation of range.
<dt><br>.
<dd>Match any character.
<dt><br>^
<dd>Match start of line.
<dt><br>$
<dd>Match end of line.
<dt><br>@
<dd>Search with case sensitivity.
<dt><br>~
<dd>Search without case sensitivity.
<dt><br>!
<dd>If it occurs as the first character in a regular expression, the magic setting is ignored; that is, all magic characters are
 treated as magical.&nbsp; !&nbsp; is treated as a regular character if it occurs anywhere but at the very start of the regular
 expression.
<dt><br>char
<dd>Any character.
<dt><br>\char
<dd>Forces \char to be accepted as char (no special meaning) except \t matches a tab character if<b><i> realtabs</i></b> is set.
</dl>
<h2 id="File_Matching_Regular_Expressions"> File Matching Regular Expressions </h2>
<br>When specifying a file name in the Editor, it is possible to use a file matching regular expression.&nbsp; This expression
 is similar to a regular expression, but has a couple of differences:
<ol>
<li>A dot (.) specifies an actual dot in the file name.
<li>An asterisk (*) is the same as .* (matches 0 or more characters).
<li>A question mark (?) is the same as a regular expression dot (.); that is, a question mark matches exactly one character.
<li>A caret (^) has no meaning.
<li>A dollar sign ($) has no meaning.
<li>The backslash (\) has no meaning.&nbsp; It is used to separate directories.
</ol>
<br>Suppose we have the following list of files:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.c</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc.c</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bcd.c</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bad</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xyz.c</tt>
<br><br>The following examples show how the files from the above list are matched by various file name regular expressions.
<dl>
<dt>a*.c
<dd>All files that start with<tt> a</tt> and end in<tt> .c.</tt>&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> a.c</tt> and<tt> abc.c</tt>
<dt><br>(a|b)*.c
<dd>All files that start with an a or a b and end in .c.&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> a.c, abc.c,</tt> and<tt> bcd.c</tt>
<dt><br>*d.c
<dd>All files that end in<tt> d.c.</tt>&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> bcd.c</tt>
<dt><br>*
<dd>All files.
<dt><br>*.*
<dd>All files that have a dot in them.&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> a.c, abc.c, bcd.c, xyz.c</tt>
</dl>
<h2 id="Replacement_Strings"> Replacement Strings </h2>
<br>There are special characters to use in the replacement string if you use regular expressions in the search and replace
 function.
<dl>
<dt>&amp;
<dd>Replace each instance of &amp; in the replacement string with the entire string of matched characters
<dt><br>\\
<dd>Enter a \ in the replacement string
<dt><br>\n
<dd>Replace with a new line
<dt><br>\t
<dd>Replace with a tab (if<b><i> realtabs</i></b> is set)
<dt><br>\&lt;n&gt;
<dd>Replace each instance of &lt;<b> n</b> &gt;, where &lt;<b> n</b> &gt; is a digit from 0 to 9, with the n'th sub-expression
 in the regular expression
<dt><br>\u
<dd>Change the next item in the replacement string to upper case
<dt><br>\l
<dd>Change the next item in the replacement string to lower case
<dt><br>\U
<dd>Change all items following \U in the replacement string with upper case, until \e, or \E is encountered
<dt><br>\L
<dd>Change all items following \L in the replacement string with lower case, until \e, or \E is encountered
<dt><br>\e, \E
<dd>End the change to upper (\U) or lower case (\L)
<dt><br>\|&lt;n&gt;
<dd>Substitute spaces up to column &lt;n&gt;, so that the item that follows occurs at column &lt;n&gt;
<dt><br>\#
<dd>Substitute the current line number on which the match occurred.
</dl>
<h2 id="Controlling_Magic_Characters"> Controlling Magic Characters </h2>
<br>By default, all special characters in a regular expression are magical; that is, if a special character is used, it has
 a special meaning.&nbsp; To use a special character, like (, you must escape it (\().
<br><br>However, it is possible to change this using the<b><i> magic</i></b> setting in the General Options dialog.&nbsp;
 If<b><i> magic</i></b> is turned on, then all special characters are magical.&nbsp; If<b><i> magic</i></b> is turned off,
 then any special characters listed in<b> Magic String Edit Control</b> in the General Options dialog lose their special meaning
 and are treated as regular characters.&nbsp; If<b><i> magic</i></b> is turned off and you want to use the characters in their
 magical way, you must escape them with a \.
