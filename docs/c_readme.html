<h1 id="Introduction_to_Open_Watcom_CDCPP"> Introduction to Open Watcom C/C++ </h1>
<br>Welcome to the Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9 development system.&nbsp; Open Watcom C/C++ is an Open Source successor to commercial
 compilers previously marketed by Sybase, Powersoft and originally WATCOM International Corp.
<br><br>Version 1.9 of Open Watcom C/C++ is a professional, optimizing, multi-platform C and C++ compiler with a comprehensive
 suite of development tools for developing and debugging both 16-bit and 32-bit applications for DOS, extended DOS, Novell
 NLMs, 16-bit OS/2, 32-bit OS/2, Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me, Win32s, and Windows NT/2000/XP (Win32).
<br><br>You should read the entire contents of this booklet, as it contains information on new programs and modifications
 that have been made since the previous release.
<hr>
<br><b>Special NOTE to users of previous versions!&nbsp; See the section entitled</b> <a href="#Release_Notes_for_Open_Watcom_CDCPP_1_9">Release Notes for Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9</a><b>
 to determine if you need to recompile your application.</b>
<hr>
<h2 id="What_is_in_version_1_9_of_Open_Watcom_CDCPP_"> What is in version 1.9 of Open Watcom C/C++? </h2>
<br>Version 1.9 incorporates the features professional developers have been demanding:
<dl>
<dt>Open, Multi-target Integrated Development Environment
<dd>The IDE allows you to easily edit, compile, link, debug and build applications for 16-bit systems like DOS, OS/2 1.x, and
 Windows 3.x and 32-bit systems like extended DOS, Novell NLMs, OS/2, Windows 3.x (Win32s), Windows 95/98/Me, and Windows
 NT/2000/XP.&nbsp; Projects can be made up of multiple targets which permit a project to include EXEs and DLLs.&nbsp; The
 IDE produces makefiles for the project which can be viewed and edited with a text editor.&nbsp; The IDE is hosted under Windows
 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000/XP, and 32-bit OS/2.
<dt><br>The Widest Range of Intel x86 Platforms
<dd>

 Watcom C/C++ interoperates with IBM's OS/2 Developer's Toolkit (available from IBM).&nbsp; These tools have been seamlessly
 integrated into the IDE.&nbsp; The resource compiler allows you to incorporate these resources into your application.
<dt><br>Resource Compiler
<dd>Produces a compiled resource file from a source file.
<dt><br>Zoom
<dd>Magnifies selected sections of your screen.
<dt><br>Heap Walker
<dd>Displays memory usage for testing and debugging purposes.
<dt><br>Spy
<dd>Monitors messages passed between your application and Windows.
<dt><br>DDESpy
<dd>Monitors all DDE activity occurring in the system.
<dt><br>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom
<dd>Enables you to debug your program by examining both the program and the system after an exception occurs; monitors native
 applications running under Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT/2000/XP.
</dl>
<dt><br>Assembler
<dd>An assembler is included in the package.&nbsp; It is compatible with a subset of the Microsoft macro assembler (MASM).
<dt><br>C++ Class Libraries
<dd>Open Watcom C/C++ includes container and stream class libraries.
<dt><br>Royalty-free 32-bit DOS Extender

<h1 id="Installation"> Installation </h1>
<br>The package contains the following components:
<ul>
<li><b> Open Watcom C/C++ CD-ROM</b>
<li><b> This manual</b>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hardware_and_Software_Requirements"> Hardware and Software Requirements </h2>
<br>Open Watcom C/C++ requires the following minimum configuration:
<ul>
<li>IBM PC compatible
<li>An 80386 or higher processor
<li>8 MB of memory
<li>Hard disk with enough space available to install the components you require.
<li>A CD-ROM disk drive
</ul>
<br>In addition to the above requirements, you need one of the following operating systems:
<ul>
<li>DOS version 5.0 or higher
<li>Microsoft Windows version 3.1 running in enhanced mode
<li>Microsoft Windows 95 or higher
<li>Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1 or higher
<li>IBM OS/2 2.1 or higher
</ul>
<h2 id="The_README_File"> The README File </h2>
<br>Before you install Open Watcom C/C++, you should read the contents of the &quot;README&quot; file which is stored in the
 root directory of the CD-ROM.&nbsp; It contains valuable, up-to-date information concerning this product.
<h2 id="Installing_Open_Watcom_CDCPP"> Installing Open Watcom C/C++ </h2>
<br>The installation program in this version has been completely redesigned with several new &quot;smart&quot; features.&nbsp;
 If you have installed a previous version of Open Watcom C/C++ then you should install Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9 into the same
 path (except for the reason described in the following paragraph).&nbsp; It will examine a previous installation to determine
 what features were previously installed.&nbsp; It will use this information to establish default settings for the installation
 that you are about to attempt.&nbsp; Of course, you can add or remove features as you progress through the installation steps.
<br><br>If you are installing only one of the Open Watcom C/C++ or Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products and you have an older version
 of the other product, we do NOT recommend that you install the new product into the same directory as the old product.&nbsp;
 The Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products are compatible at the same version number.&nbsp; However, the Open
 Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products are usually NOT compatible across different version numbers.&nbsp; If this
 is the case, care must be exercised when switching between use of the two products.&nbsp; Environment variables such as<b>
 PATH</b> and<b> WATCOM</b> must be modified and/or corrected.&nbsp; System files such as<tt> CONFIG.SYS</tt> and<tt> SYSTEM.INI</tt>
 must be modified and/or corrected.
<br><br>If you are installing both Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9 and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 1.9, we recommend that you install both
 products under the same directory.&nbsp; This will eliminate duplication of files and, as a result, reduce the total required
 disk space.&nbsp; The two products share the use of certain environment variables which point to the installation directory.
&nbsp; If separate installation directories are used, problems will arise.
<br><br>When you install Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 in the same directory, you should not deselect any options
 when running the second installation; otherwise the second product's install may remove files that were installed (and are
 required) by the first product's install.&nbsp; This isn't an issue if you only have one of Open Watcom C/C++ or Open Watcom
 FORTRAN 77.&nbsp; The problem is that Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 don't know about the installation options
 you have selected for each other's product.
<br><br>If you wish to create a backup of your previous version, please do so before installing Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9.
<br><br>If you decide to install Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9 into a different directory than the previously installed version, you
 will have to manually edit system files (e.g., CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI) after the installation process is complete
 to remove the old version from various environment variables (e.g., PATH, DEVICE=).&nbsp; This is necessary since the path
 to the new version will appear after the path to the old version.&nbsp; To avoid this extra work, we recommend installing
 the new version into the same path as the old version.
<br><br>As an example, here are a few of the environment variables and &quot;RUN&quot; directives that are modified/added
 to the OS/2<tt> CONFIG.SYS</tt> file.&nbsp; You should make sure that all references to the older version of the software
 are removed.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIBPATH=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\DLL;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET PATH=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP;D:\WATCOM\BINW;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET HELP=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\HELP;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET BOOKSHELF=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\HELP;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET INCLUDE=...;D:\WATCOM\H\OS2;D:\WATCOM\H;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET WATCOM=D:\WATCOM</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET EDPATH=D:\WATCOM\EDDAT</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RUN=D:\WATCOM\BINP\NMPBIND.EXE</tt>
<br><br>You may wish to run Open Watcom C/C++ under more than one operating system on the same personal computer.&nbsp; For
 every operating system that you use, simply start up the operating system and run the corresponding install procedure.
<br><br>If you run the Windows 3.x installation procedure, you do not need to run the DOS installation procedure also.
<br><br>If you plan to use Win-OS/2 as a development platform under OS/2, you must run the Windows 3.1 install program (selecting
 Windows 3.1 host support).
<br><br>Place the CD-ROM disk in your CD-ROM drive.&nbsp; Select one of the following procedures depending on the host operating
 system that you are currently running.&nbsp; Below, substitute the CD-ROM drive specification for &quot;x:&quot;.

<h2 id="Incremental_Installation"> Incremental Installation </h2>
<br>You may wish to install Open Watcom C/C++, and subsequently install features that you omitted in the first install.&nbsp;
 You can also remove features that you no longer wish to have installed.&nbsp; You can achieve this as follows:
<ol>
<li>Start the installation program.
<li>Select any new features that you wish to install.
<li>Deselect any features that you wish to remove.
<li>Re-run the installation program for each host operating system that you use.
</ol>
<h2 id="System_Configuration_File_Modifications"> System Configuration File Modifications </h2>
<br>The install program makes changes to your operating system startup files to allow Open Watcom C/C++ to run.&nbsp; We strongly
 recommend that you allow the install program to modify your system configuration files for you, but you may do it by hand.
&nbsp; The changes required may be found in any of the following files which have been placed in the root of the installation
 directory:
<dl>
<dt>CONFIG.NEW
<dd>Changes required for<tt> CONFIG.SYS</tt> (DOS, Windows, Windows 95/98/Me, OS/2)

<h2 id="Installation_Notes_for_Windows_3_x"> Installation Notes for Windows 3.x </h2>
<ol>
<li>When you use the Integrated Development Environment under Windows 3.x, it is important that the IDE's batch server program
 be able to run in the background.&nbsp; Therefore, make sure that the &quot;Exclusive in Foreground&quot; checkbox is NOT
 checked in the &quot;Scheduling&quot; options of &quot;386 Enhanced&quot; in the &quot;Control Panel&quot;.
<li>When you use the Integrated Development Environment under Windows 3.x, the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OverlappedIO=ON</tt>
<br><br>in your &quot;SYSTEM.INI&quot; file can cause problems.&nbsp; This controls (disables) the queuing of DiskIO and makes
 some changes between DOS box timings to allow some processes to finish.
<li>When you use the Integrated Development Environment under Windows 3.x, it is important that the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NoEMMDriver=ON</tt>
<br><br>not appear in your &quot;SYSTEM.INI&quot; file.&nbsp; It will prevent a link from succeeding in the IDE..
<li>When you use the Integrated Development Environment under Windows 3.x on the NEC PC-9800 series, it is important that
 the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; InDOSPolling=TRUE</tt>
<br><br>not appear in your &quot;SYSTEM.INI&quot; file.&nbsp; It will prevent a make from succeeding in the IDE.
<li>Central Point Software's anti-virus programs (VDEFEND, VSAFE, VWATCH) conflict with the Integrated Development Environment
 under Windows 3.x.
<li>The Program Information File &quot;BATCHBOX.PIF&quot; is used by the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to start
 up a background batch server for compiling, linking, etc.&nbsp; The PIF references &quot;COMMAND.COM&quot;.&nbsp; If you
 are using a substitute for &quot;COMMAND.COM&quot; such as &quot;4DOS.COM&quot; then you must modify the PIF accordingly
 using a PIF editor.
</ol>
<h2 id="Installation_Notes_for_OSD2"> Installation Notes for OS/2 </h2>
<ol>
<li>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) uses the IBM OS/2 Enhanced System Editor (EPM) for editing text files.&nbsp;
 You must ensure that EPM is installed in your OS/2 system if you are planning to use the IDE.&nbsp; You can selectively install
 the Enhanced Editor by running the OS/2 Setup and Installation program (Selective Install) and choosing &quot;Enhanced Editor&quot;
 from the &quot;Tools and Games&quot; detail page.
<li>On some systems with limited memory that use the UNDELETE feature of OS/2, compile times may be slow because OS/2 is saving
 copies of compiler temporary files.&nbsp; You may start the BATSERV process using the OS/2<tt> STARTUP.CMD</tt> file with<b>

<h1 id="HandsMon_Introduction_to_Open_Watcom_CDCPP"> Hands-on Introduction to Open Watcom C/C++ </h1>
<br>Let's get started and introduce some of the tools that are in Open Watcom C/C++.&nbsp; The purpose of this chapter is
 to briefly test out the new graphical tools in Open Watcom C/C++ using an existing application.
<br><br>In this tutorial, we will take an existing set of C++ source files, create a project in our integrated development
 environment, and perform the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Add multiple targets
<li>Make a target
<li>Make all targets
<li>Execute the program
<li>Debug the program
<li>Use the Browser
<li>Correct errors
<li>Sample and profile the executable
<li>Save the project
<li>Terminate the session
</ul>
<h2 id="Outline"> Outline </h2>
<br>Open Watcom's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) manages the files and tools that a programmer uses when developing
 a project.&nbsp; This includes all the source files, include files, libraries, compiler(s), linkers, preprocessors, etc.
&nbsp; that one uses.
<br><br>The IDE has a graphical interface that makes it easy to visualize the make-up of a project.&nbsp; A single IDE session
 shows a project.&nbsp; If the project consists of a number of components, such as two executables and one library, these
 are each shown as target windows in the project window.&nbsp; Each target window shows the files that are needed to construct
 the target and is associated via its filename extension with a rule that describes the construction mechanism.&nbsp; For
 example, a filename with the extension &quot;.EXE&quot; may be associated with the rule for constructing 32-bit Windows executables,
 or a filename with the extension &quot;.LIB&quot; may be associated with the rule for constructing static libraries.&nbsp;
 Different projects can refer to the same target.&nbsp; If they do, the target is shared and can be manipulated via either
 project, with changes made through one affecting the other.
<br><br>The IDE itself is a collection of programs that manages the various files and tools used to create the target libraries
 and executables.&nbsp; It creates makefile(s) from the information in the target descriptions and invokes Open Watcom Make
 to construct the targets themselves.&nbsp; A configuration file contains built-in knowledge of the Open Watcom compilers,
 editors, Profiler, and Browser, as well as all their switches.
<h2 id="The_Open_Watcom_CDCPP_Tutorial"> The Open Watcom C/C++ Tutorial </h2>
<br>This tutorial walks you through the creation and execution of a C/C++ program under Windows.&nbsp; This will give you
 an understanding of the basic concepts of the IDE and its components, and it will detail the steps involved in project development.
&nbsp; The result of this tutorial is a three dimensional drawing of a kitchen which you can manipulate using either the menus
 or the icons on the toolbar.&nbsp; You can rotate and resize the drawing, as well as adjust the lighting and contrast.
<br><br>To begin, start the IDE.&nbsp; This is done by double-clicking on the &quot;IDE&quot; icon in the Open Watcom C/C++
 window.
<br><br>A status field at the bottom of the IDE window indicates the function of the icon on the toolbar over which your mouse
 cursor is currently positioned.&nbsp; If the status area does not show you the function of the icons as you move the mouse
 cursor over them, check that no item in the menu bar is highlighted (if one is highlighted, press the Alt key).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide1c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

<h3 id="Defining_a_Project"> Defining a Project </h3>
<br>In this tutorial, you will be creating a new project called<tt> KITCHEN.</tt>&nbsp; Here are the steps required to accomplish
 this task.
<ol>
<li>Define a new project by pulling down the<b> File</b> menu and selecting the<b> New Project...</b>&nbsp; item.&nbsp; You
 can also define a new project by clicking on the &quot;Create a new project&quot; icon on the toolbar.
<li>A choice of different sample project directories is available.&nbsp; Assuming that you installed the Open Watcom C/C++
 software in the<tt> \WATCOM</tt> directory, you will find the sample project directories in the following directory:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \WATCOM\SAMPLES\IDE</tt>
<br><br>For purposes of this tutorial, we recommend that you select one of the following project directories:
<dl>
<dt>WIN
<dd>for an example of 16-bit Windows 3.x application development when using Windows 3.x under DOS as a host development system,
<dt><br>WIN386
<dd>for an example of 32-bit Windows 3.x application development when using Windows 3.x under DOS as a host development system,
<dt><br>WIN32
<dd>for an example of 32-bit Win32 application development when using Windows NT/2000/XP or Windows 95/98/Me as a host development
 system, and
<dt><br>OS2
<dd>for an example of 32-bit OS/2 application development when using 32-bit OS/2 as a host development system.
</dl>
<br>Thus the<tt> target</tt> that we refer to below should be one of<tt> WIN, WIN386, WIN32,</tt> or<tt> OS2</tt> depending
 on your selection.&nbsp; The tutorial uses the<tt> WIN32</tt> example for illustrative purposes.&nbsp; You will find some
 minor variations from your selected target environment.
<br><br>When asked for a project name, you can do one of two things:
<ol>
<li>enter the following pathname:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d:&#91;path&#93;\SAMPLES\IDE\target\KITCHEN</tt>
<br><br>where<tt> d:&#91;path&#93;</tt> is the drive and path where you installed the Open Watcom software, or
<li>use the file browser to select the following directory:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d:&#91;path&#93;\SAMPLES\IDE\target</tt>
<br><br>and specify the filename<tt> kitchen.</tt>
</ol>
<br><tt><img src="ide2c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 2.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Creating a new project</b>
<br><br>Press the Enter key or click on OK (OPEN).
<br><br>The project description will be stored in this file and the IDE will set the current working directory to the specified
 path during your session.
<li>You will be prompted for a target name.&nbsp; Since we will be attaching pre-defined targets, just click the<b> Browse</b>
 button when prompted for the target name.&nbsp; Select the &quot;draw&quot; target file (it will be one of<tt> draw16.tgt,
 draw.tgt, draw32.tgt, drawos2.tgt</tt> depending on your selection of target).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide3c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 3.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Attaching existing targets</b>
<br><br>Press the Enter key or click on OK (OPEN).
<li>You can ignore the settings displayed for<b> Target Environment</b> and<b> Image Type</b> since the target definition
 already exists (we created it for you).&nbsp; The settings are important when you are defining a new target (i.e., one that
 was not predefined).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide4c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 4.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Selecting a target type</b>
<br><br>Press the Enter key or click on OK.
</ol>
<br>A target window is created in the project window for the &quot;draw&quot; target.&nbsp; This window contains all of the
 files associated with the target.&nbsp; You can click on any of the &quot;Folder&quot; icons to hide or un-hide all files
 with a particular extension.&nbsp; For example, you may wish to un-hide all the files with a<tt> .bmp</tt> extension by clicking
 on the folder icon associated with bitmap files.
<h3 id="Adding_Multiple_Targets"> Adding Multiple Targets </h3>
<br>Open Watcom's IDE allows you to have multiple targets in any particular project.&nbsp; Note that targets can be used by
 multiple projects.&nbsp; To add a new target to the project, do the following.
<ol>
<li>Pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu and select the<b> New Target...</b>&nbsp; item.
<li>Enter<tt> button.tgt</tt> as the target name for the new target to be added to the project.&nbsp; Do not forget to include
 the<tt> .tgt</tt> extension.&nbsp; It is required when selecting a pre-existing target.
<li>You can ignore the settings displayed for<b> Target Environment</b> and<b> Image Type</b> since the target definition
 already exists (we created it for you).&nbsp; The settings are important when you are defining a new target (i.e., one that
 was not predefined).
<li>Press the Enter key or click on OK.
</ol>
<br>A target window is created in the project window for the<tt> button</tt> target.
<h3 id="Making_a_Target"> Making a Target </h3>
<br>Open Watcom's IDE will automatically generate the sequence of steps required to build or &quot;make&quot; each of the
 targets in a project.&nbsp; Note that the targets in a project can be made individually or collectively.&nbsp; To make the<tt>
 button.lib</tt> target, do the following.
<ol>
<li>Click on the window of the target you wish to make.&nbsp; In this case, click on the<tt> button.lib</tt> target window.
<li>Pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu and select the<b> Make</b> item (you can also do this by clicking on the &quot;Make
 the current target&quot; icon on the toolbar, or by right-clicking on the target and selecting the<b> Make</b> item from
 the pop-up menu).
</ol>
<br>The IDE will now construct a makefile based on its knowledge of the target and construction rules, and then invoke the
 make utility to create the target, in this case<tt> button.lib.</tt>&nbsp; The output of this procedure is displayed in the
 Log window.
<h3 id="Making_All_Targets"> Making All Targets </h3>
<br>Click the &quot;Make all targets in the project&quot; icon on the toolbar to make all of the targets in the current project.
&nbsp; If one target depends on another target, the latter target will be made first.&nbsp; In this tutorial<tt> button.lib</tt>
 will be made first (there will be nothing to do since it was made previously) and then<tt> draw???.exe,</tt> since<tt> button.lib</tt>
 is in the list of files associated with<tt> draw???.exe.</tt>&nbsp; In each case, the IDE constructs makefiles based on its
 knowledge of the target and construction rules.&nbsp; The output of this procedure is displayed in the Log window.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide5c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 5.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Making one or more targets</b>
<h3 id="Executing_the_Program"> Executing the Program </h3>
<br>The project should have built without errors, so now you are ready to execute the program you have developed.
<br><br>Click on the<tt> draw???.exe</tt> target window and simply click on the &quot;Run the current target&quot; icon on
 the toolbar.&nbsp; You can also do this by selecting<b> Run</b> from the<b> Targets</b> menu, or right-clicking anywhere
 on the target window outside of the inner frame and selecting<b> Run</b> from the pop-up menu (right-clicking is context
 sensitive and the pop-up menu that results will vary depending on the area of the window in which you right-click).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide6c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 6.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The kitchen demo</b>
<br><br>The demo you have created is a simple three dimensional drawing of a kitchen.&nbsp; By using either the icons on the
 toolbar or the menus you can rotate the picture left, right, up, and down, make the picture brighter or dimmer, move the
 picture closer or farther away, and increase or decrease the amount of contrast (this latter feature is found in the &quot;Lighting&quot;
 menu).&nbsp; Choose<b> Exit</b> from the<b> File</b> menu to exit the demo program when you are finished.
<h3 id="Smart_Editing"> Smart Editing </h3>
<br>The IDE recognizes the type of file you wish to edit, and invokes the appropriate editor for the task.&nbsp; To edit a
 file, you either double-click on it or select it and click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon on the toolbar.&nbsp; Files with a<tt>
 .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .for, .asm</tt> or<tt> .rc</tt> extension are edited with a text editor; files with a<tt> .bmp, .ico,</tt>
 or<tt> .cur</tt> extension are edited with the Image Editor; files with a<tt> .dlg</tt> or<tt> .res</tt> extension are edited
 with the Resource Editor.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide7c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 7.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Editor for Windows</b>
<br><br>Now we will edit one of the source files and introduce an error into the application.
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the &quot;draw&quot; source file (i.e.,<tt> draw???.c</tt>) to load the source file into the editor.
<li>Scroll down to line 227 using the keyboard or mouse.&nbsp; You can also pull down the<b> Edit</b> menu, select<b> Goto
 Line...,</b> and enter 227.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Editor makes full use of colors and fonts to achieve syntax highlighting.
&nbsp; File templates for C, C++, and FORTRAN files are defined to assist you in distinguishing the components of your code.
<li>Pull down the<b> Options</b> menu and select the<b> Colors</b> item.
<li>Click on a color from the palette, drag it to the word<tt> if</tt> on line 218, and release it.&nbsp; All keywords are
 now displayed in the chosen color.&nbsp; Drag a different color to a comment line (line 225) and all comments will display
 in that color.&nbsp; Similarly, you can select the Fonts item from the Options menu, select a font style and size, and drag
 it to your source file.&nbsp; Close the Fonts and Colors dialog by double-clicking in the upper left hand corner.
<li>You can now save this color and font configuration for all<tt> .cpp</tt> files by pulling down the<b> Options</b> menu,
 selecting the<b> General...,</b> item and clicking next to<b> Save configuration on exit</b> in the &quot;Features&quot;
 box.&nbsp; Press Enter or click on OK.
<li>Now, to introduce an error into the application, replace the line<tt> #if 0</tt> with<tt> #if 1.</tt>
<li>Save your changes by clicking on the &quot;Write the current file to disk&quot; icon or select<b> Save</b> from the<b>
 File</b> menu.
<li>Return to the IDE (by clicking on it if it is visible on your screen, or by using Alt-Tab), re-make your project, and
 run it.&nbsp; A fault occurs in your application, so the next step is to track down the problem using the Open Watcom Debugger.
</ol>
<h3 id="Debugging_the_Program"> Debugging the Program </h3>
<br>To debug a program it must first be compiled to include debugging information.&nbsp; The IDE maintains two sets of switches
 for each target in a project.&nbsp; These are known as the Development Switches and the Release Switches.
<ol>
<li>Right click on<tt> draw???.c</tt> and select<b> Source options</b> from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Select<b> C Compiler Switches</b>
 from the sub-menu.
<br><br>By default, your target is placed in development mode with the debugging switches for the compiler and linker set
 to include debugging information.&nbsp; You can either set the switches in each category manually or you can copy the default
 Release switches using the CopyRel button.&nbsp; This method of setting switches is especially convenient since you can specify
 everything from diagnostic, optimization, and code generation switches to special linker switches all without having to memorize
 a cryptic switch name - you simply click next to the switches you wish to use for a particular item.
<li>Scroll through the categories using the &gt;&gt; button until you get to:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Debugging Switches</tt>
<br><br>We can see that full debugging information was used in the compile, so just click on<b> Cancel</b> to exit this screen.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide8c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 8.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Setting compiler switches</b>
<li>To invoke the debugger, pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu and choose the<b> Debug</b> item or select the &quot;Debug the
 current target&quot; icon from the toolbar.
</ol>
<br>The Open Watcom Debugger is designed to be as convenient and intuitive as possible, while at the same time providing a
 comprehensive and flexible environment for serious debugging.&nbsp; You can configure your environment to display exactly
 the information you require to be most productive.&nbsp; Among the windows available are source and assembly, modules, functions,
 calls, threads, images, watches, locals, globals, file variables, registers, 80x87 FPU, stack, I/O ports, memory display,
 and a log window.&nbsp; You can step through your source using the keys or icons on the toolbar.&nbsp; Execute one line at
 a time by stepping over calls or stepping into calls, or execute until the current function returns.&nbsp; Right-mouse button
 functionality gives context-sensitive pop-up menus.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide9c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 9.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Debugger</b>
<br><br>We know that a fault has occurred in<tt> draw???.exe,</tt> so we will run the application and examine the state of
 the program when the fault occurs.
<ol>
<li>Click on the &quot;go!&quot; icon on the toolbar to begin execution of the program.&nbsp; The exception occurs and the
 source window shows the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *pwidth = bitmap.bmWidth + 5;</tt>
<br><br>in the function<tt> button_size</tt> as the last line executed before the exception.&nbsp; Examining the Locals window
 you will see that<tt> pwidth</tt> is a NULL pointer, hence the exception.
<li>We can now move up the call stack by clicking on the &quot;Move up the call stack&quot; icon on the toolbar (red up arrow)
 to follow the program's execution.&nbsp; On the previous line, we see<tt> button_size</tt> is called from<tt> add_button.</tt>
&nbsp; Moving up the call stack again, we see<tt> add_button</tt> is called with NULL as its fifth parameter.&nbsp; An artificial
 error has been introduced for the purposes of this tutorial.&nbsp; It is located several lines back in the source file.
<li>By replacing the line<tt> #if 1</tt> with<tt> #if 0</tt> we can bypass this error.&nbsp; Right-click on the line<tt> #if
 1</tt> and select Show, then Line...&nbsp; from the pop-up menus to see the line number which must be corrected, then exit
 the debugger.
<li>Double-click on<tt> draw???.c</tt> to load the source file into the editor.
<li>Scroll down to line 227 using the keyboard or mouse, or pull down the<b> Edit</b> menu, select<b> Goto Line...,</b> and
 enter 227.

<h3 id="Using_the_Source_Browser"> Using the Source Browser </h3>
<br>Suppose you wanted to change the color of the tabletop in your application.&nbsp; You can use the Open Watcom Browser
 to determine the code you will need to change.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Browser provides an easy way to examine the class definitions,
 member functions, and inheritance trees associated with your C++ code.&nbsp; First, you need to instruct the compiler to
 emit Open Watcom Browser information.

<li>Click on the<tt> draw???.exe</tt> target.
<li>Select the<b> Sample</b> item from the<b> Targets</b> menu item, or click on the &quot;Run and sample the current target&quot;
 icon from the toolbar.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Execution Sampler is invoked and your application begins to execute.
<li>Try rotating and resizing the image a few times.&nbsp; The sampler takes a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the code that is being
 executed at regular intervals.&nbsp; Exit the application.&nbsp; A samples file with extension<tt> .smp</tt> is created in
 the current directory.&nbsp; This file is input for the profiler.
<li>You are now ready to profile the executable.&nbsp; Do this by selecting<b> Profile</b> from the<b> Targets</b> menu, or
 by clicking on the &quot;Profile the current target&quot; icon on the toolbar.&nbsp; The profiler scans the<tt> .smp</tt>
 file and reports the activity in the various modules of the application.&nbsp; The percentage of time spent in the modules
 is indicated as an absolute percentage (percent of total samples) and as a relative percentage (percent of samples in the<tt>
 .exe</tt> image).
<li>Double-click on the module or routine names to step down to the exact source being executed when a sample was taken.&nbsp;
 For more details, you can adjust the sampling rate of the Sampler to get a better picture of your code.&nbsp; To do this,
 exit the Profiler, pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu, and select<b> Target options,</b> then<b> Sample Switches...</b>&nbsp;
 from the pop-up menus.&nbsp; Specify a sampling rate such as 2 (for 2 milliseconds), click on OK, then run the Sampler and
 Profiler again.

<h1 id="Benchmarking_Hints"> Benchmarking Hints </h1>
<br>The Open Watcom C/C++ compiler contains many options for controlling the code to be produced.&nbsp; It is impossible to
 have a certain set of compiler options that will produce the absolute fastest execution times for all possible applications.
&nbsp; With that said, we will list the compiler options that we think will give the best execution times for most applications.
&nbsp; You may have to experiment with different options to see which combination of options generates the fastest code for
 your particular application.
<br><br>The recommended options for generating the fastest 16-bit Intel code are:&nbsp; 
<dl>
<dt>Pentium Pro
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /6 /fpi87 /fp6
<dt><br>Pentium
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /5 /fpi87 /fp5
<dt><br>486
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /4 /fpi87 /fp3
<dt><br>386
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /3 /fpi87 /fp3
<dt><br>286
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /2 /fpi87 /fp2
<dt><br>186
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /1 /fpi87
<dt><br>8086
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /0 /fpi87
</dl>
<br>The recommended options for generating the fastest 32-bit Intel code are:&nbsp; 
<dl>
<dt>Pentium Pro
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /6 /fp6
<dt><br>Pentium
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /5 /fp5
<dt><br>486
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /4 /fp3
<dt><br>386
<dd>/onatx /oh /oi+ /ei /zp8 /3 /fp3
</dl>
<br>The &quot;oi+&quot; option is for C++ only.&nbsp; Under some circumstances, the &quot;ob&quot; and &quot;ol+&quot; optimizations
 may also give better performance with 32-bit Intel code.
<br><br>Option &quot;on&quot; causes the compiler to replace floating-point divisions with multiplications by the reciprocal.
&nbsp; This generates faster code (multiplication is faster than division), but the result may not be the same because the
 reciprocal may not be exactly representable.
<br><br>Option &quot;oe&quot; causes small user written functions to be expanded in-line rather than generating a call to
 the function.&nbsp; Expanding functions in-line can further expose other optimizations that couldn't otherwise be detected
 if a call was generated to the function.
<br><br>Option &quot;oa&quot; causes the compiler to relax alias checking.
<br><br>Option &quot;ot&quot; must be specified to cause the code generator to select code sequences which are faster without
 any regard to the size of the code.&nbsp; The default is to select code sequences which strike a balance between size and
 speed.
<br><br>Option &quot;ox&quot; is equivalent to &quot;obmiler&quot; and &quot;s&quot; which causes the compiler/code generator
 to do branch prediction (&quot;ob&quot;), generate 387 instructions in-line for math functions such as sin, cos, sqrt (&quot;om&quot;),
 expand intrinsic functions in-line (&quot;oi&quot;), perform loop optimizations (&quot;ol&quot;), expand small user functions
 in-line (&quot;oe&quot;), reorder instructions to avoid pipeline stalls (&quot;or&quot;), and to not generate any stack overflow
 checking (&quot;s&quot;).&nbsp; Option &quot;or&quot; is very important for generating fast code for the Pentium and Pentium
 Pro processors.
<br><br>Option &quot;oh&quot; causes the compiler to attempt repeated optimizations (which can result in longer compiles but
 more optimal code).
<br><br>Option &quot;oi+&quot; causes the C++ compiler to expand intrinsic functions in-line (just like &quot;oi&quot;) but
 also sets the<b> inline_depth</b> to its maximum (255).&nbsp; By default,<b> inline_depth</b> is 3.&nbsp; The<b> inline_depth</b>
 can also be changed by using the C++<tt> inline_depth</tt> pragma.
<br><br>Option &quot;ei&quot; causes the compiler to allocate at least an &quot;int&quot; for all enumerated types.
<br><br>Option &quot;zp8&quot; causes all data to be aligned on 8 byte boundaries.&nbsp; The default is &quot;zp2&quot; for
 the 16-bit compiler and &quot;zp8&quot; for 32-bit compiler.&nbsp; If, for example, &quot;zp1&quot; packing was specified
 then this would pack all data which would reduce the amount of data memory required but would require extra clock cycles
 to access data that is not on an appropriate boundary.
<br><br>Options &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot; and &quot;6&quot;
 emit Intel code sequences optimized for processor-specific instruction set features and timings.&nbsp; For 16-bit Intel applications,
 the use of these options may limit the range of systems on which the application will run but there are execution performance
 improvements.
<br><br>Options &quot;fp2&quot;, &quot;fp3&quot;, &quot;fp5&quot; and &quot;fp6&quot; emit Intel floating-point operations
 targetted at specific features of the math coprocessor in the Intel series.&nbsp; For 16-bit Intel applications, the use
 of these options may limit the range of systems on which the application will run but there are execution performance improvements.
<br><br>Option &quot;fpi87&quot; causes in-line Intel 80x87 numeric data processor instructions to be generated into the object
 code for floating-point operations.&nbsp; Floating-point instruction emulation is not included so as to obtain the best floating-point
 performance in 16-bit Intel applications.
<br><br>For 32-bit Intel applications, the use of the &quot;fp5&quot; option will give good performance on the Intel Pentium
 but less than optimal performance on the 386 and 486.&nbsp; The use of the &quot;5&quot; option will give good performance
 on the Pentium and minimal, if any, impact on the 386 and 486.&nbsp; Thus, the following set of options gives good overall
 performance for the 386, 486 and Pentium processors.

<h1 id="Release_Notes_for_Open_Watcom_CDCPP_1_9"> Release Notes for Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9 </h1>
<br>There are a number of enhancements and changes in this new version of Open Watcom C/C++.&nbsp; The following sections
 outline most of the major changes.&nbsp; You should consult the User's Guide for full details on these and other changes
 made to the compiler and related tools.&nbsp; You should check the next section to determine if you need to recompile your
 application.
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_version_1_8"> Differences from Open Watcom version 1.8 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9:
<ul>
<li>The NULL macro is now defined as ((void *)0) for C; for C++, NULL is still defined as 0 or 0L as previously.&nbsp; This
 change may require modifications to user code if NULL was incorrectly used as an integer constant.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; The
 16-bit windows.h header defines NULL as 0; for 16-bit Windows programming, the effective definition of NULL depends on whether
 windows.h or one of the standard C headers is included first.
<li>The C compiler has improved handling of the _Bool type (C99 mode specific).&nbsp; The _Bool type can now generally be
 used in expressions wherever an integer may be used.
<li>The C compiler now considers enumeration types to be compatible with their underlying integer type, as required by ISO
 C.&nbsp; Note that the choice of the underlying type varies and should not be relied upon.
<li>The C compiler now correctly handles initialization of static floating-point variables with 64-bit integer constants.
<li>The C and C++ compilers now support the __int8, __int16, and __int32 extension keywords.
<li>The 16-bit C and C++ compilers now allow the :&gt; operator to be used in initializers of variables with static storage,
 as long as both operands are integer constants.&nbsp; This enables the use of MK_FP macro in initializers.
<li>The C++ compiler now treats warning W737, implicit conversion of pointers to integral types of same size, as an error.
<li>The C++ compiler now supports several new warnings:&nbsp; W931, warn about meaningless cv-qualifier in casts; W932, warn
 about meaningless cv-qualifier in function return types; and W933, warn about use of C-style casts in C++ code.&nbsp; These
 warnings must be explicitly enabled through the -wce option.
<li>The code generator now eliminates redundant epilogue code for 32-bit Intel processors when doing size optimization.
<li>The code generator correctly handles constant folding of signed 64-bit integer division and right shift operations.
<li>The code generator now supports constant folding of 64-bit integer modulo operations.
<li>The code generator no longer mishandles floating-point comparisons where one operand is a variable of type float and the
 other operand is a constant of type double or long double.
<li>The code generator no longer produces incorrect code when a constant expression of type float (e.g., 1.0f + 1.0f) is passed
 as an argument to a function which takes a float argument.
<li>The code generator now makes more accurate decision when choosing whether a multiplication by a constant should be replaced
 by a sequence of shifts and additions.&nbsp; Results depend on target CPU type.
<li>The 386 code generator now produces a CDQ instruction except when targeting a Pentium and optimizing for speed, when a
 MOV/SAR sequence is emitted as previously when converting a signed 32-bit integer to 64-bit.
<li>The code generator no longer emits redundant CS segment overrides when creating calls to symbols imported from DLLs.
<li>The Win32 API headers and import libraries have been updated to support the new interfaces in Windows 7.
<li>Support for 16-bit OLE 2.0 has been added.
<li>Support for RDOS targets has been added.
<li>Support for ZDOS targets has been added to the linker.
<li>The floating-point exception handler for 16-bit DOS no longer crashes if the user signal handler modified DS.
<li>The _floodfill() graphics library function now works correctly again.
<li>The library no longer leaks memory when a thread created by _beginthread() terminates.
<li>The %Lf format specifier (and related format specifiers) used with printf family functions now works.
<li>The library now contains _fseeki64 and _ftelli64 functions to handle 64-bit file offset pointer for streams.
<li>The library implementations of _lseeki64, _telli64, _fileleni64, _(w)stati64, _(w)findfirsti64, _(w)findnexti64 on OS/2
 now properly use 64-bit file sizes and offsets.
<li>The library implementations of puts and putws now correctly return EOF if they fail
<li>DOS long file name (LFN) support has been added (new doslfn??.lib model specific libraries contain DOS LFN version of
 appropriate modules).&nbsp; By default DOS LFN support is enabled.&nbsp; It can be switch off by setup LFN=N environment
 variable.
<li>The wasm assembler now implements support for Turbo Assembler compatible IDEAL mode.&nbsp; The -zcm option may be used
 to select this feature.
<li>The assembler now supports built-in @code and @data symbols.
<li>The assembler now supports ELSEIF directives for conditional assembly.
<li>The assembler no longer incorrectly assumes that absolute segments are byte aligned; they are paragraph (16 byte) aligned.
<li>The built-in cd command in wmake now supports quoted paths with spaces.
<li>The linker now supports libraries in BSD, COFF, and GNU ar format.
<li>The linker now allows stack sizes smaller than 512 bytes to be specified and does not silently override them.&nbsp; However,
 a new warning (W1172) will be emitted in such case.
<li>A FULLHEADER option specific to the DOS EXE format has been added to the linker.&nbsp; Please see the Linker Guide for
 further information.
<li>The library manager (wlib) now supports BSD, COFF, and GNU variants of the ar library archive format.&nbsp; Extended -fab,
 -fag, -fac options select the variant.&nbsp; The -fa option now selects default format depending on host platform.
<li>This release introduces Open Watcom's IPF compiler (wipfc) used for creating help files on OS/2.
<li>Documentation is now provided in Windows CHM format as an option.
<li>The vi editor now supports non-ASCII characters in the 0x80-0xFF range.
<li>The console version of the vi editor for Windows now uses standard Windows keyboard processing; AltGr and dead keys now
 function correctly.&nbsp; Additionally, Caps Lock is only effective for keys which generate characters.
<li>The editor now supports for syntax highlight of awk files.
<li>The editor now supports a Select All command.
<li>The windowed editor now holds the position of the replace and search/replace dialogs between invocations.
<li>The wcl and wcl386 utilities now work correctly on a Linux host.
<li>The DOS NetBIOS trap file and debug server have been modified to work when running on Windows NT (through NTVDM).
<li>The 16-bit Windows GUI tools no longer require CTL3DV2.DLL, but still use it if the library is present.
</ul>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_7"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.7 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.8:
<ul>
<li>The C compiler now performs stricter type checking on enumerated types.&nbsp; Previously, enums were treated as their
 underlying type (signed/unsigned char, int, etc.) for type checks.
<li>The C compiler now adds location information about enumerated symbols in appropriate diagnostics.
<li>The C compiler has been improved with respect to the handling of near/far pointers, especially when converting or comparing
 pointers and integers of different sizes.
<li>The C compiler now properly recognizes functions that do not return, such as longjmp(), and correctly diagnoses control
 flow issues such as unreachable code or missing return statements.
<li>The C compiler now supports a #pragma alias.&nbsp; This pragma emits alias records into the object file for processing
 by the linker.
<li>The C compiler now has larger capacity and can compile some complex source files that previously caused out of memory
 errors (E1064).
<li>The C compiler now always warns about unprototyped functions (W131).&nbsp; Previously, some forgivable instances of missing
 prototypes were undiagnosed by default, which caused users to write non-portable code usually by accident.
<li>Warning W139 (Divisor for modulo or division operation is zero) has been added to the C compiler.&nbsp; This warning is
 triggered whenever the right operand of an integer division or modulo operation is a constant expression with the value of
 zero.
<li>The handling of pragma aux is now correct in cases where code is emitted and a function body already exists for the corresponding
 symbolic name.
<li>Various fixes to the handling of the include_alias pragma have been made.
<li>The C and C++ compilers now have diagnostics for meaningless comparison of 64-bit and bit-field operands.
<li>The C and C++ compilers now have conversion tables from CP=1250,1252 (Latin-2,1 for Windows ANSI) to Unicode to support
 Windows programming.
<li>The C++ compiler now supports the explicit specification of function template arguments.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; f&lt;T&gt;().
<li>The C++ compiler now uses lazy instantiation for class templates and template members.&nbsp; Only the members actually
 used are instantiated.
<li>The C++ compiler now allows member templates to be defined outside their class.
<li>Numerous bugs in the C++ compiler have been fixed.
<li>The C++ compiler allows a class declaration with modifiers to have those modifiers propagate into the class definition.
<li>When -SH switch is used with the Fortran compiler, the default size of an integer constant is now INTEGER*2.
<li>The Fortran compiler no longer crashes when equivalencing common/global with automatics.
<li>Fortran processing for the text record EOL has been normalized.&nbsp; On UNIX systems write/seek uses LF and read uses
 LF or CRLF.&nbsp; On non-UNIX systems write/seek uses CRLF and read uses LF or CRLF.
<li>Various code generation bug fixes to both the 16-bit and 32-bit compilers have been made.
<li>The Win32 headers and libraries are now Open Watcom's own internal version.&nbsp; The MinGW headers and libraries are
 no longer being used.&nbsp; The new headers and libraries provider greater compatibility with the Microsoft SDK and better
 support for Microsoft Vista.
<li>The version of Causeway in the official distribution is now version 4.03.
<li>The Linux run time libraries now have recvfrom() and sendto() implementations.
<li>A POSIX compatible fnmatch() function and a corresponding fnmatch.h header has been added.
<li>The _dos_getfileattr() function no longer crashes in large data models on 16-bit DOS and Windows.
<li>The C run time library now has implementations of the following functions to improve compatibility with other compilers:
&nbsp; _chmod, _chsize, _creat, _dup2, _eof, _filelength, _isatty, _read, _sopen, _tell, _umask, _unlink, and _write.
<li>The date and time arguments to _dos_getftime() and _dos_setftime() are now using 'unsigned int' type instead of 'unsigned
 short'.&nbsp; This change has been made to improve compatibility with other compilers.
<li>The segment argument used with _dos_allocmem(), _dos_freemem() and _dos_setblock() is now unsigned int instead of unsigned
 short.&nbsp; This change was made for compatibility with other compilers.
<li>The Fortran run time environment now works on Linux.
<li>The Linux Fortran run time libraries now have FSYSTEM and FSPAWN implementations.
<li>The Fortran run time now exposes the saved stack pointer for when crashes occur in the IO subsystems.
<li>The debugger's options context menu now has an option to allow all child nodes to be expanded recursively.
<li>The debugger now uses the full size of the type when displaying hexadecimal values (for example 0x03 instead of 0x3).
<li>The debugger now has a new menu entry to change the display format of all values in an array (all hex or all decimal).
<li>The debugger now supports break on write rather than just break on change.&nbsp; The trap must support exact breakpoints
 for this to happen.
<li>The Windows debugger now properly handles quoted program names.
<li>The Windows debugger now has proper color support.
<li>The NetWare TCP server and trap have been updated for NW6.5SP7 with the latest libcpre.obj file.
<li>The DOS real-mode trap file (std.trp) now correctly displays high parts of 32-bit registers on 386+ CPUs.&nbsp; Previously,
 the high parts were always displayed as zeros.
<li>WLIB now has a new -pa option to set up library page size automatically to optimal size.
<li>WLIB now handles COFF import libraries more correctly.
<li>WCL now properly handles the -fd and -fm options without the file name specified.
<li>WASM now handles EXTERNDEF directives properly; an EXTDEF record is created only if the symbol is actually referenced.
<li>WASM now handles the auto-dependency filename properly.
<li>WASM now implicitly creates the __UNIX__ macro for the BSD target as it has for LINUX and QNX.
<li>The internal version numbers for WASM and WMAKE are now compatible with that used by the C and C++ compilers.&nbsp; Specifically
 the macro __WASM__ has the value 1280 for WASM and the macro __VERSION__ has the value 1280 for WMAKE.
<li>The 32-bit DOS WD and WPROF can now be used with DOS/4G 2.x.&nbsp; The DOS4GOPTIONS settings are no longer exported.&nbsp;
 Users may still override the defaults by supplying their own wd.ini and wprof.ini, respectively.&nbsp; These files must be
 in the appropriate format for the DOS/4G version used.&nbsp; Note that this does not affect DOS/4GW users.
<li>WLINK now handles offsets and groups larger than 64 KB for 32 bit code and 16 bit targets.
<li>WLINK now ignores fixup displacement when the target relocation is absolute.&nbsp; This is required for compatibility
 with object files generated by MASM 5.1.
<li>WLINK now properly handles the alignment of the last segment in a group if the last segment fragment is blank.
<li>WLINK can now use the WLINK_LNK environment variable to override the default directive file name (wlink.lnk).&nbsp; If
 the specified file isn't found then default file is used as usual.
<li>WLINK now properly emits segments overlapped by groups to output file.
<li>WLINK now properly handles imported symbols that are locally defined with the dllimport specifier in PE formatted files.
<li>WLINK DLL was renamed from wlink.dll to wlinkd.dll.&nbsp; It requires to correct wmake directive &quot;!loaddll&quot;
 to use this new name if it is used in makefile.
<li>WRC on Far-Eastern NT-based systems now honors the DBCS encoding specified on the command line.
<li>The text editor now supports syntax highlighting for resource files.
<li>The Fgrep dialog box in graphical editor now has a browse button to display the standard browse for folder dialog box
 on versions of Windows that support it.
<li>The ide2make utility has been added to the Open Watcom distribution.&nbsp; This utility converts IDE project files to
 make files.
<li>The exe2bin utility now performs properly if relocation items are unsorted.
<li>The installer now generates a batch file that automatically sets the environment variables used by the Open Watcom tools.
</ul>
<h2 id="Changes_in_1_8_that_may_Require_Recompilation"> Changes in 1.8 that may Require Recompilation </h2>
<dl>
<dt>_dos_getftime and _dos_setftime functions
<dd>32-bit users of _dos_getftime() and _dos_setftime() need to recompile.&nbsp; Consider using stat()/utime() instead of the
 non-portable functions.
<dt><br>_dos_allocmem and _dos_freemem functions
<dd>32-bit DOS users of _dos_allocmem() and _dos_freemem() need to recompile.&nbsp; Consider not using this functions in the first
 place.
</dl>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_6"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.6 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.7:
<ul>
<li>Functions using the __cdecl calling convention now return floating-point values in FPU registers in 32-bit code.&nbsp;
 This is the correct behavior compatible with other compilers.
<li>The C and C++ compilers now support an include_alias pragma which can be used, among other things, to map long include
 filenames onto 8.3 names.&nbsp; In addition, the compilers now support a -na switch to disable the automatic inclusion of
 _ialias.h (which contains new include_alias pragmas for certain standard headers).
<li>The C compiler now emits warnings on operations which mix multi-level pointer types such as void** and int**.&nbsp; Previously
 a warning was only emitted in ANSI mode.&nbsp; Note that while void** is not assignment compatible with int**, void* is.
&nbsp; The new stricter behavior is in line with most other C compilers and helps users write cleaner and more portable code.
<li>The C compiler now warns (W400) when an expression of plain char type is used as array index.&nbsp; Because the sign of
 plain char changes depending on compiler choice and settings, using plain char as array index is inherently non-portable
 and likely to cause problems.
<li>The C compiler now folds constant expression before checking for range overflows etc.&nbsp; This enables the compiler
 to diagnose constant out of range issues in more cases.
<li>The C compiler now allows benign variable redefinitions where __near or __far modifiers aren't always explicitly specified
 but match when current data model is taken into account (eg.&nbsp; 'extern int __near x;' and 'extern int x;' in small data
 models).&nbsp; The new behavior is compatible with the C++ compiler as well as with other vendors' compilers.
<li>The default stack size for 32-bit DOS extended executables has been increased from 4K to 64K.&nbsp; Note that the linker
 can still set greater or smaller stack size.
<li>The code generator now produces better 16-bit code for 64-bit math operations
<li>The code generator no longer incorrectly optimizes out conditionals.&nbsp; The problem only occurred in very rare situations
 and probably only when doubles were being compared.
<li>A long-standing problem with use of certain 64-bit constants as results of ternary operators has been fixed.
<li>The C++ compilers now has a workaround for bugzilla bug #63 (http://bugzilla.openwatcom.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63).&nbsp;
 The compiler now generates an error message referring to the bug entry rather than crashing.
<li>The LIBC and CLIB thin netware libraries have been added to the distribution as experimental.
<li>32-bit DOS executables now correctly pass environment to child processes started through the spawn family of functions.
&nbsp; Previous incorrect behavior was introduced in version 1.6.
<li>In the NetWare libraries, __get_stdout with __get_std_stream was causing an infinite recursion.&nbsp; This has been fixed.
<li>Fixed 8087 emulator/mathlib 80-bit real multiplication if one operator is zero and second is a power of two.
<li>The _outgtext() function in graph.lib no longer fails on 32-bit targets.
<li>The Win32 stat() function now returns correct results when it tries to access a file with given name and the directory
 containing that file also contained a subdirectory with the same name.
<li>The debugger now supports a &quot;No Source&quot; toggle (right mouse click menu) in the assembly code window to switch
 on/off associated source code.
<li>The debugger no longer crashes when tracing F77 programs that use variable-size arrays.&nbsp; This only applies to DWARF
 debugging information (which is used by default).
<li>The debugger now correctly displays multi-dimensional Fortran arrays when DWARF debug information format is used (which
 is used by default).
<li>The debugger can now display &#91;partial&#93; strings in Fortran code when the string length exceeds the debugger's internal
 limit.&nbsp; The internal limit has also been increased from 512 to 1024 characters.
<li>The resource compiler now properly copies non-resident name table when processing LX executables.
<li>The console version of vi for Win32 no longer quits after Ctrl+Left is pressed followed by any other key.
<li>WCL now correctly takes options from the environment when there is more then one file to compile.
<li>The linker now supports a MIXED1632 option to allow mixing of 16- and 32-bit logical segments into a single physical segment
 in OS/2 LX/LE executables.
<li>The linker now supports a NOSTUB option for Windows and OS/2 executable formats.&nbsp; This option causes no DOS stub
 executable to be written to the output image.
<li>The installer now allows you to disable creating program groups or modifying the startup environment using the /np and
 /ns switches.
</ul>
<h2 id="Changes_in_1_7_that_may_Require_Recompilation"> Changes in 1.7 that may Require Recompilation </h2>
<dl>
<dt>__cdecl Calling Convention
<dd>Functions in 32-bit code that return floating-point values now do so using the FPU registers.&nbsp; Such functions will need
 to be recompiled if they are to be linked with object code produced by Open Watcom C/C++ 1.7.
</dl>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_5"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.5 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.6:
<ul>
<li>The C compiler has been modified to use the underlying bit-field type and not signed/unsigned int as the type of operand
 which is a bit-field.&nbsp; This is consistent with the C++ compiler and fixes some problems when bit-fields larger than
 int are used.
<li>Processing of #pragma aux has been corrected in the C compiler.&nbsp; This fixes problems when using the mmintrin.h header,
 among others.
<li>The C compiler now accepts __declspec modifiers specifying calling conventions applied to variables, not just functions.
&nbsp; The new behavior is consistent with the C++ compiler, and also with the fact that ordinary calling convention type
 modifiers can be used with variables.
<li>The C and C++ compilers have been fixed to properly declare variable names based on calling convention specifiers.&nbsp;
 This fixes problems with building code using IBM SOM.&nbsp; Note that the current behavior is the same as in Open Watcom
 1.3 and earlier.
<li>The C compiler's preprocessor has been modified to allow use of macros with large number of arguments (255 or more).
<li>The C compiler no longer generates internal errors when options -ri and -oe are specified at the same time.
<li>The C++ compiler has been fixed to inline intrinsic functions.
<li>The 386 compilers have been changed to default to tuning code for P6 architecture instead of Pentium.&nbsp; Optimizing
 for P6 typically results in slightly more compact and faster code.
<li>The 386 C compiler has been fixed to properly convert between flat and __far16 pointers, especially pointers to functions.
&nbsp; Its behavior should now be compatible with the C++ compiler.&nbsp; The problem was most likely affecting OS/2 users
 who wrote mixed 16-bit and 32-bit code.
<li>The C compiler has been changed to allow redeclaration of functions in rare cases where initial declaration did not specify
 a calling convention and the subsequent declaration specified a calling convention which matched the default.
<li>A new -zwf switch has been added to the C and C++ compilers.&nbsp; This switch is off by default and enables generation
 of FWAIT instructions on 386 and later CPUs.&nbsp; It is only needed in unusual situations.
<li>The C compiler now correctly converts 64-bit integer constants to floating-point constants.
<li>The code generator no longer merges memory accesses when volatile variables are involved.
<li>The code generator now correctly const folds 64-bit right shifts.
<li>The code generator now properly converts between far pointers and 64-bit integers.&nbsp; Attempts to convert a 48-bit
 far pointer to 64-bit integer no longer cause a crash.
<li>The code generator has been modified to slightly decrease code size when optimizing for size (-os).
<li>The non-standard alloca.h header has been added for compatibility with other compilers.
<li>The strftime() library function has been extended to support date formats introduced in C99.
<li>The file pointer type used with lseek() and tell() has been changed to off_t (from long) for compatibility with POSIX.
<li>The 386 versions of _clear87() and _status87() functions have been modified to use the no-wait form of FPU control instructions.
&nbsp; This allows these functions to be used in exception handlers when there are pending unmasked floating-point exceptions.
<li>The 16-bit 8087 emulator has been fixed to correctly evaluate multiplies as infinity instead of zero in rare overflow
 situations.
<li>The resource compiler (wrc) has been fixed to store long integer constants as 32-bit quantities in RCDATA or user data
 resource statements.&nbsp; This behavior applies to Win16, Win32, and OS/2 targets.&nbsp; Integers without the 'L' suffix
 are stored as 16-bit and potentially truncated.
<li>The OS/2 specific part of the resource compiler has been corrected to process RCDATA statements properly.
<li>The assembler (wasm) now supports external absolute symbols.&nbsp; The SIZE, SIZEOF, LENGTH, and LENGTHOF operators have
 been corrected for structures.
<li>Classification of privileged instructions in the assembler has been updated to match MASM.
<li>The assembler now evaluates expressions in return instructions correctly.&nbsp; Previously, code such as 'ret 28+4' would
 be sometimes erroneously assembled as 'ret 28' instead of 'ret 32'.
<li>The linker has been changed to only recognize segments of class 'STACK' as stack segment.&nbsp; Previously, any segment
 with class name ending with 'STACK' (eg.&nbsp; 'FSTACK') was recognized.
<li>Several minor problems related to creating DOS executables have been fixed in the linker.
<li>The RUNTIME linker directive has been extended to allow ELF ABI type and version specification.&nbsp; This functionality
 is similar to the brandelf utility.&nbsp; See the Linker Guide for details.
<li>The wmake utility has been modified such that in native wmake mode, a symbolic target with no command list is always considered
 to have had its command list executed.&nbsp; That will cause any targets that are dependent on this symbolic target to be
 considered out of date.
<li>The Win32 trap file is now able to determine the full pathname of debuggee's loaded DLLs.&nbsp; This may ease debugging
 in some cases as the debugger will be more likely to find debugging information for DLLs.
<li>The Win16 debugger trap file (std.dll) has been modified to allow 16-bit wdw to run on Windows NT platforms without reporting
 a spurious error message on exit.
<li>Numerous problems with the Win386 extender support have been fixed so that Win386 now works again.
<li>The dmpobj utility has been enhanced to support additional OMF records, and new command line options have been added.
</ul>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_4"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.4 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.5:
<ul>
<li>Support for ISO/IEC TR 24731, &quot;Extensions to the C Library, Part I:&nbsp; Bounds-checking interfaces&quot; has been
 added to the C runtime library.&nbsp; The C compiler now predefines the macro __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ (which evaluates to 200509L)
 to indicate this support.&nbsp; This set of functions is also known as the Safer C Library.&nbsp; Please see the C Library
 Reference for detailed documentation of these functions.
<li>In C99 mode, the C compiler now supports C99 style declarations intermixed with statements within a block, as well as
 declarations in the opening clause of a for loop.
<li>The C compiler now predefines additional macros required by the C standards.&nbsp; These include __STDC_HOSTED__ (evaluates
 to 1) to indicate a hosted implementation and __STDC_VERSION__ (either 199409L or 199901L) to indicate C94 or C99 support
 depending on compilation switches.
<li>A __restrict keyword has been added to the C compiler.&nbsp; It is functionally equivalent to the C99 'restrict' keyword
 but is always visible, even in non-C99 mode.
<li>In C99 mode, the C compiler no longer requires explicit return statement in a main function returning an integer.&nbsp;
 In accordance with C99 standard, 'return 0;' is implied if end of function is reached and no return statement was encountered.
<li>The C compiler has been fixed so that it no longer loses track of pointer base when using __based(__self) pointers.&nbsp;
 The C compiler has also been fixed to properly handle dereferencing of based arrays.
<li>The 16-bit C++ compiler now correctly casts pointers to __segment type without crashing.&nbsp; Proper semantics of the
 cast were implemented.
<li>The 16-bit C compiler has also been modified to handle casts to __segment type correctly, ie.&nbsp; return segment portion
 of a pointer.
<li>The C compiler has been fixed to properly support named based segments (ie.&nbsp; __based( __segname( &lt;name&gt; ) )
 pointers) that reference the default _DATA and _CONST segments.
<li>The compilers and library headers have been modified to properly support use of standard libraries when one of the -ec
 switches is used to change default calling convention.
<li>The C compiler has been modified such that segments created through #pragma data_seg are no longer part of DGROUP.&nbsp;
 Typically, the pragma is used only when data segments need to be located in a physically separate segment in the output module.
<li>New warning W137, &quot;Extern function 'fn' redeclared as static&quot;, has been added to the C compiler.&nbsp; Existing
 error E1072, &quot;Storage class disagrees with previous definition of 'symbol'&quot; has been extended to cover redefinitions
 from 'extern' to 'static' and not only from 'static' to 'extern'.&nbsp; Changing the linkage of a symbol invokes undefined
 behavior according to ISO C.
<li>New warning W138, &quot;No newline at end of file&quot;, has been added to the C compiler.&nbsp; It is emitted if no line
 terminator character was found before the end of a source file.&nbsp; Such files do not conform to ISO C.&nbsp; The missing
 newline character will be automatically inserted; this matches the C++ compiler behavior.&nbsp; Note that missing newlines
 could previously lead to spurious &quot;#endif matches #if in different source file&quot; warnings.
<li>The C compiler has been modified to allow the __export or __declspec(dllexport) modifier on a declaration when earlier
 declaration exists with no modifier.&nbsp; The updated behavior is compatible with the C++ compiler as well as some compilers
 from other vendors.
<li>In ISO/ANSI mode (-za), the compiler now always warns if it encounters a call to unprototyped function.&nbsp; In extensions
 mode (default, -ze), this warning (W131) is suppressed if a matching prototype is found later in the source file.&nbsp; Note
 that the behavior in extensions mode is unchanged from earlier versions.
<li>The C compiler now eliminates static functions that are always inlined from the object file (the functions are of course
 still emitted if their address is taken).
<li>The C compiler has been fixed to properly evaluate boolean expressions (especially the ternary operator) where the condition
 is a 64-bit integer constant.&nbsp; Previously, the high 32 bits were in some cases ignored, which could lead to erroneous
 results.
<li>The C compiler has been modified to properly cast floating-point constants to the specified type.&nbsp; Notably FLT_MIN
 stored or passed as double is now handled correctly (without spurious precision).
<li>Handling of empty macro arguments has been corrected in the C compiler's preprocessor.&nbsp; Previously, empty macro arguments
 could result in invalid tokens in certain cases.
<li>The peephole optimizer is now run again after register allocation.&nbsp; This allows the code generator to take advantage
 of some optimization opportunities that were previously missed.
<li>The code generator has been modified to copy DS into ES in __interrupt routine prolog (right after DS was loaded) if the
 ES register is considered unalterable, ie.&nbsp; in flat model.&nbsp; This may avoid crashes if ES is dereferenced explicitly
 or implicitly in interrupt handlers, for instance when calling memcpy().
<li>The linker and other tools have been fixed to correctly classify code segments.&nbsp; Previously, code segments could
 be misclassified as data, which led to incorrect disassembly and generation of debugging information.
<li>A performance problem related to emitting debugging information for structures or unions with many members has been corrected
 in the code generator.
<li>The POSIX-defined header libgen.h has been implemented.&nbsp; This includes two functions, basename() and dirname().
<li>The functions btowc(), fwide(), mbsinit(), wctrans(), and towctrans() have been added to the C runtime library.&nbsp;
 These functions are all related to wide-character and multi-byte support, and were first defined by the ISO C Normative Amendment
 1.
<li>C99 functions llabs(), lldiv(), and _Exit() have been added to the C runtime library.&nbsp; Note that the latter is equivalent
 to _exit(), defined by POSIX.
<li>Support for C99 floating-point classification macros has been implemented.&nbsp; This includes fpclassify, isfinite, isinf,
 isnan, isnormal, and signbit.
<li>Modifiers 'hh', 'j', 'z', and 't' defined by C99 for the printf and scanf family of functions have been implemented in
 the C runtime library.&nbsp; Please see the C Library Reference for details.
<li>The 'F' modifier for printf and scanf families of functions conflicts with 'F' format specifier defined by ISO C for floating-point
 conversions.&nbsp; It has been replaced by a 'W' modifier which is now used to denote a far pointer.&nbsp; The 'F' modifier
 is still recognized in DOS builds of the runtime library (which therefore cannot handle the 'F' format specifier as defined
 by ISO C), but is no longer documented and will be removed in a future release.
<li>Several very obscure bugs have been fixed in the printf and scanf family of functions.&nbsp; These problems were discovered
 thanks to a more stringent testing procedure and had never been reported by users.
<li>The strtod function has been enhanced to follow C99 specification.&nbsp; It will now parse infinity and NaN, as well as
 hexadecimal floating-point numbers.&nbsp; See the C Library Reference for details.
<li>The math library has been fixed to perform binary to decimal floating-point conversions with greater precision.&nbsp;
 This fixes a problem where in some cases a conversion from binary to decimal and back was losing precision or producing erroneous
 results.
<li>The graphics library has been fixed to correctly work with VESA modes where the number of bytes per line does not directly
 correspond to width of the mode in pixels.
<li>The owcc utility has been much improved and documented; this tool is a POSIX style compiler driver, designed to provide
 certain level of command line compatibility with gcc and ease porting.
<li>The NOEXTension linker option has been documented; this option instructs the linker not to add any extension (.exe, .dll,
 etc.) to the executable name.&nbsp; Any argument to the NAME directive will be used verbatim.&nbsp; This option had been
 supported by earlier versions of the linker but not documented.
<li>The 'include' preprocessor directive not prefixed by an exclamation mark is now recognized in wmake -ms mode for compatibility
 with Microsoft and IBM NMAKE.
<li>The wmake utility has been enhanced to evaluate NMAKE style '&#91;cmd&#93;' expressions (ie.&nbsp; shell commands) in
 preprocessor !if directives.&nbsp; This functionality is supported in both wmake and -ms mode.
<li>Several problems related to the Watcom debugging information format have been fixed in the linker and debugger.&nbsp;
 Note that the Watcom format is considered obsolete and its use is not recommended.
<li>A random but very rare startup failure of Windows based GUI tools (notably wdw) has been fixed.
</ul>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_3"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.3 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.4:
<ul>
<li>Support for C99 designated initializers has been added to the C compiler, for example &quot;struct {int a, b;} c = {.a=0,
 .b=1};&quot;.&nbsp; This is also supported for arrays, for example &quot;int a&#91;4&#93; = {&#91;0&#93;=5, &#91;3&#93;=2};&quot;.
<li>Handling of enumerations has been fixed in the C compiler.&nbsp; In certain cases, the compiler chose the wrong type for
 operations on objects of enumerated types.&nbsp; Enumerated constants up to 64 bits wide are now also allowed (including
 in 16-bit compilers).
<li>The C compiler will now warn if the right hand operand of a bitwise shift expression is a constant that is either negative
 or greater than or equal to the bit with of the promoted left operand.&nbsp; The result of such operation is not defined
 by ISO C.&nbsp; The warnings are 'W134:&nbsp; Shift amount negative' and 'W135:&nbsp; Shift amount too large'.
<li>The C compiler now warns in cases where an unsigned type is compared for &lt;= 0.&nbsp; This is equivalent to 'unsigned
 == 0' and often indicates that a signed comparison was intended.
<li>New __watcall keyword has been added to the C and C++ compilers to designate the default Watcom calling convention.
<li>New -ec?&nbsp; switches have been added to set the default calling convention.
<li>The 16-bit C compiler now defines _M_I86 macro for consistency with the C++ compiler.&nbsp; The new macro should be used
 in preference to the existing M_I86.
<li>A number of new keywords have been added to the C compiler; these were previously defined as macros:&nbsp; _Cdecl, _Export,
 _Far16, _Fastcall, _Pascal, __sycall, _System, __try, __except, __finally, __leave.
<li>Analogous change has been made to the C++ compiler.&nbsp; The new keywords (and removed predefined macros) are:&nbsp;
 _Cdecl, _Export, _Far16, _Fastcall, __inline, _Pascal, __syscall, _System.
<li>The C++ compiler now handles the &quot;new&quot; template specialization syntax, and partial specialization is partially
 supported (no pun intended).
<li>The C++ compiler now correctly handles the situation where control reaches the end of main() function without encountering
 a return statement.&nbsp; In that case, the effect is that of executing &quot;return 0;&quot;.
<li>The C++ compiler now properly allows return statements with a void expression in functions that return void.
<li>386 C and C++ compilers now support the Microsoft fastcall calling convention, and recognize the __fastcall keyword.
<li>The C compiler now recognizes #pragma data_seg and code_seg forms that specify segment and class names without enclosing
 them in parentheses.&nbsp; The new behavior is consistent with other compilers.
<li>New -fti switch has been added to the C compiler to track #include file opens.&nbsp; This helps diagnose include file
 problems in complex projects.
<li>The code generator no longer emits debug information for unreferenced typedefs when -d1+ or -d2 switch is used.&nbsp;
 This produces slightly to significantly smaller debug information.&nbsp; Note that behavior of -d3 is unchanged.
<li>The 386 code generator will no longer select the 'and' instruction to perform zero extension when optimizing for time
 on the 686 architecture (-6r or -6s switch).&nbsp; The 'movzx' instruction will always be used instead, because it avoids
 partial register stalls and in certain cases significantly improves performance on P6 and newer class CPUs.
<li>Support for long long based bitfields has been improved in the code generator.
<li>The code generator now properly diagnoses attempts to emit symbol names that overflow the OMF limit (255 bytes).
<li>Several problems related to loss of segment information in 386 non-flat models have been fixed in the code generator.
<li>Command line processing has been changed in the Compile and Link utility (wcl).&nbsp; Forward slashes now may be used
 as path separators in file arguments, such that &quot;foo/bar&quot; is now interpreted as &quot;foo\bar.c&quot;.&nbsp; Note
 that this does not affect options delimited with forward slashes.
<li>Support for raw binary and Intel Hex output has been added to the linker, along with support for 24-bit segmented addressing
 architectures (HSHIFT option) and arbitrary class/segment reordering (OUTPUT and ORDER directives).&nbsp; See Linker Guide
 for details.
<li>Support for overlays (16-bit DOS) has been reinstated in the linker.&nbsp; A related FARCALLS/NOFARCALLS option has been
 added to the linker.&nbsp; See Linker Guide for details.
<li>The linker now correctly processes relocations to symbols in absolute segments.
<li>The linker now checks for bitness conflicts (16 vs.&nbsp; 32-bit) when adding segments to a group.
<li>The minimum accepted value for linker OBJALIGN option has been changed to 16 bytes (previously 512).
<li>The linker no longer creates a separate .bss section when linking PE modules.&nbsp; Instead, uninitialized data is added
 at the end of the data section.&nbsp; This creates slightly smaller executables and reduces memory usage.
<li>The st_name member was removed from struct stat and related structures.&nbsp; This was done for consistency across platforms
 (UNIX has no such field), because the st_name field was almost entirely useless (being limited to 13 characters), and for
 compatibility with Microsoft compilers; the latter because struct _wstat and struct _wstati64 are now obsolete and struct
 _stat/_stati64 can be used for wide character stat functions.&nbsp; NB:&nbsp; This change requires recompilation.&nbsp; New
 object files will not work with old libraries and vice versa.
<li>The signal() function no longer modifies floating-point control word on Win32 and 32-bit OS/2.&nbsp; Also, default value
 for SIGFPE has been changed to SIG_DFL from SIG_IGN on all platforms.
<li>The e/E format of printf() family of functions has been changed to format the exponent with minimum of two digits (instead
 of three).&nbsp; This behavior is dictated by C99 and consistent with most other compilers.
<li>The floating-point to string conversion routines now format values with greater precision.&nbsp; This means that floating-point
 values printed by C and C++ programs may be slightly different from earlier versions of the runtime libraries (but more accurate).
<li>The sleep() function is now declared in unistd.h and its return type has been changed to unsigned int, for compatibility
 with POSIX.
<li>The clock() function now uses millisecond counters (where available) on DOS and Windows, and is no longer susceptible
 to problems related to TZ changes.
<li>The DOS runtime has been tuned to produce smaller executables.
<li>C99 functions wmemchr(), wmemcmp(), wmemcpy(), wmemmove(), and wmemset() have been added to the C runtime library.
<li>A POSIX compatible getopt() function has been added to the C runtime library.
<li>A POSIX compatible mkstemp() function has been added to the C runtime library.
<li>BSD compatible safe string copy and concatenation functions, strlcpy() and strlcat(), have been added.&nbsp; Use of these
 functions is highly recommended over strncpy() and strncat(), because they are safer and much easier to use.
<li>New strings.h header has been added for POSIX compatibility, although legacy functions index() and rindex() are not supported.
&nbsp; Functions strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() are also declared in string.h for compatibility with other compilers.
<li>The C runtime library no longer returns ESPIPE when calling write() on a pipe or device that was opened with O_APPEND
 flag.&nbsp; The old behavior was not POSIX conforming.
<li>Handling of pathnames that include spaces has been improved in the make utility (wmake).
<li>The disassembler (wdis) now handles big endian object files on little endian host platforms, and vice versa.
<li>Support for MIPS R4000 and SPARC V8 instruction sets has been added to the disassembler.
<li>New -zz and -zzo option have been added to the assembler (wasm) for backwards compatibility.&nbsp; See Tools User's Guide
 for details.
<li>Default behavior of inline assembler has changed.&nbsp; The CPU optimization level (-4, -5, -6) now implies the available
 instruction set:&nbsp; -5 implies MMX and 3DNow!, -6 also implies SSE/SSE2/SSE3.&nbsp; Also note that any CPU setting override
 now reverts to default at the end of each inline assembly block.
<li>16-bit DOS version of the assembler (wasmr) has been added.&nbsp; This version runs on 8086 and above and requires less
 memory than the protected mode version.
<li>The debugger has been changed to look for support files in directories relative to the debugger executable's location.
&nbsp; This allows the debugger to be used when no debugger specific environment variables have been set.
<li>A problem with stepping into code (F8) right after debuggee was loaded has been fixed in the debugger.
<li>The debugger now looks for debug information in a .sym file when the /DOwnload option was specified.&nbsp; Previously
 it erroneously only looked at the executable if the download option was used.
<li>Support for Microsoft/IBM .sym files generated by the MAPSYM utility has been added to the debugger and profiler.&nbsp;
 This is helpful especially with symbol files provided by IBM for OS/2 system DLLs; disassembly now shows for instance &quot;call
 DOS32EXIT&quot; instead of &quot;call 01C74634&quot;.
<li>The CauseWay trap file no longer incorrectly maps symbol addresses in 'large' executables (code segment &gt; 64K).
<li>Interoperability with GNU tools has been improved.&nbsp; The debugger (wd/wdw) should now be able to debug GNU-produced
 executables (with DWARF 2 debug information) and vice versa.
<li>New -zld option has been added to the library manager (wlib) to strip autodependency information from OMF objects.
<li>New exe2bin utility has been added.&nbsp; See Tools User's Guide for details.
<li>Basic support for compiling OS/2 resource scripts and binding resources into OS/2 executables (both NE and LX formats)
 has been added to the resource compiler (wrc).
<li>The include search order in the resource compiler has been changed to be more consistent with the C/C++ compilers, as
 well as with IBM's and Microsoft's resource compilers.&nbsp; System include files (enclosed in angle brackets) are no longer
 searched in current directory or in the directory of the file containing the #include directive.
<li>The Windows resource compiler has been made more compatible with scripts designed for Microsoft's RC in the way it treats
 string literals.
<li>The MS LINK compatibility wrapper now supports a /RELEASE switch.
<li>Syntax highlighting support for makefiles has been added to the editor.&nbsp; The default syntax highlighting scheme has
 also been made more colorful.
<li>The editor and Windows GUI tools now store configuration files in more appropriate locations (notably on multi-user machines).
<li>Several new DOS extender related targets have been added to the IDE.&nbsp; Better support for remote debugging has also
 been added to the IDE.
<li>The CauseWay DOS extender now supports SSE instructions on plain DOS.
<li>Several simple OS/2 SOM programming examples have been added.

</dl>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_2"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.2 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.3:
<ul>
<li>The C++ compiler now restricts the scope of variables declared in a for loop to the scope of that loop in accordance with
 ISO C++, not extending the scope beyond the loop (ARM compliant behavior).&nbsp; Code relying on the pre-standard behavior
 must either be changed or compiled with new -zf switch which reverts to old scoping rules.
<li>Support for default template arguments has been added to the C++ compiler.
<li>Support for alternative tokens (and, xor etc.) has been added to the C++ compiler.&nbsp; It is enabled by default, can
 be turned off with the new -zat switch.
<li>The C runtime library has been made significantly more C99 compliant.&nbsp; A number of new headers have been added (inttypes.h,
 stdbool.h, stdint.h, wctype.h) and corresponding new functions implemented.&nbsp; Wide character classification functions
 were moved out of ctype.h into wctype.h.&nbsp; C99 va_copy macro was added to stdarg.h.
<li>Added 'cname' style C++ headers.
<li>Support for SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and 3DNow!&nbsp; instruction sets has been added.&nbsp; Affected tools are the assembler (wasm),
 as well as all x86 compilers, disassembler and debugger.&nbsp; The debugger now also supports MMX registers formatted as
 floats (for 3DNow!) as well as a new XMM register window for SSE.
<li>Inline assembler directives .MMX, .K3D, .XMM, .XMM2 and .XMM3 are now supported in the _asm as well as #pragma aux style
 inline assembler interface.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; .MMX directive is now required (in addition to .586) to use MMX instructions.
<li>C compiler performance has been significantly improved (up to 5-10 times speedup) when compiling large and complex source
 files.
<li>All x86 compilers now have the ability to perform no truncation when converting floating point values to integers.&nbsp;
 Additionally, 32-bit x86 compilers have the option to inline the rounding code instead of calling __CHP.
<li>The C lexical scanner no longer evaluates constants with (U)LL suffix that fit into 32 bits as zero (1ULL was wrong, LONGLONG_MAX
 was correct).
<li>C and C++ x86 inline assembler has been fixed to properly process hexadecimal constants postfixed with 'h'.
<li>The C compiler now supports the C99 'inline' keyword, in addition to previously supported '_inline' and '__inline' keywords.
<li>The C compiler now treats a sequence of adjacent character strings as wide if any of the components are wide (required
 by C99), instead of depending on the type of the last component.&nbsp; For example, L&quot;foo &quot; &quot;bar&quot; is
 now interpreted as L&quot;foo bar&quot;, instead of &quot;foo bar&quot;.
<li>The internal C compiler limit on complex expressions has been increased and if it is still insufficient, the compiler
 now reports an error instead of crashing.
<li>The C compiler now issues a warning on the default warning level if a function with no prototype is referenced.&nbsp;
 This was previously warning W301 (level 3), now it is warning W131 (level 1).
<li>Warning &quot;W132:&nbsp; No storage class or type specified&quot; has been added to the C compiler.&nbsp; This warning
 is issued if a variable is declared without specifying either storage class or type.&nbsp; This is not allowed in C89.
<li>Warning &quot;W304:&nbsp; Return type 'int' assumed for function 'foo'&quot; has been added.&nbsp; This warning is issued
 if a function is declared without specifying return type.&nbsp; This is allowed in C89 but not in C99.
<li>Warning &quot;W305:&nbsp; Type 'int' assumed in declaration of 'foo'&quot; has been added to the C compiler.&nbsp; This
 warning is issued if a variable is declared without specifying its type.&nbsp; This is allowed in C89 but not in C99.&nbsp;
 Note that if warning W132 is issued, W305 applies as well.
<li>The C compiler now properly warns if a function with implied 'int' return type fails to return a value.&nbsp; This potential
 error was previously undetected.
<li>C++ compiler diagnostic messages have been made more consistent and slightly more detailed.
<li>Linker for Win32 targets can now create file checksums.&nbsp; These are primarily used for DLLs and device drivers, but
 can be applied to all Win32 PE images if required.
<li>Linker for Win32 targets can now set operating system version requirements into the PECOFF optional header (Microsoft
 extended header).
<li>Linker for Win32 targets can now set the linker version number into the PE optional header (Microsoft extended header).
<li>The linker will now eliminate zero-sized segments from NE format (16-bit OS/2 and Windows) executables.&nbsp; This fixes
 a problem where Windows 3.x would refuse to load an executable with zero sized segment.&nbsp; This could happen especially
 with C++ programs where some segments may have ended up empty after eliminating unused functions.
<li>The linker now (again) produces correct Watcom style debugging information.&nbsp; This was a regression introduced in
 previous version.
<li>Command line parsing for wccxxx, wppxxx and cl has been changed such that a double backslash inside a quoted string is
 collapsed to a single backslash, and hence &quot;foo\\&quot; now translates to 'foo\' and not 'foo\&quot;'.
<li>The IDE and other graphical tools no longer leak system resources (a bug introduced in version 1.2).
<li>The Image Editor limit on bitmap size has been changed from 512x512 pixels to 2048x2048 pixels.
<li>The source browser now correctly decodes array information; Version 11.0c of Watcom C/C++ started emitting array browse
 information in a new format and the browser hadn't been updated accordingly.
<li>The NT debugger trap file has been changed so an exception generated during a step operation is handled correctly.&nbsp;
 Previously, the single step flag was not being cleared and when the exception was being offered to the debuggee's own exception
 handlers, a single step exception occurred in NT's exception handler rather than the exception being passed back to our handler.
<li>The OS/2 debuggers now dynamically allocate buffer for the command line, preventing crashes when the command line was
 over approx.&nbsp; 260 bytes long.
<li>The NetWare 5 debugger NLM has been changed to use kernel primitives.&nbsp; Previous version were using legacy semaphores.
<li>The make program (wmake) has been sped up very slightly.&nbsp; Also the 'echo' command is now internal and no longer spawns
 the system command interpreter.
<li>The precision of DBL_MAX, DBL_MIN and DBL_EPSILON has been increased; the non-standard variants prefixed with an underscore
 have been removed.
<li>The C99 functions atoll(), lltoa(), ulltoa(), strtoll(), strtoull() and corresponding wide character functions have been
 added to the C runtime library.
<li>The _beginthread() function now consistently returns -1 in case of error on all platforms.
<li>The stdaux and stdprn streams are now only defined on DOS based platforms, ie.&nbsp; DOS, Win16 and Win386.&nbsp; No other
 platforms support stdaux or stdprn.
<li>The assert() macro now prints function name in addition to source file and line number, in accordance with C99.
<li>The _heapchk() function will now always perform a consistency check on the heap, where it would previously only check
 consistency if there had been allocations/frees since last call to _heapchk().&nbsp; As a consequence, _heapchk() previously
 did not detect certain instances of heap corruption.
<li>&#91;OS/2 32-bit&#93; The default __disallow_single_dgroup() implementation no longer statically links against PMWIN.DLL.
&nbsp; This allows DLLs to load on systems where PMWIN.DLL isn't present.
<li>&#91;OS/2 32-bit&#93; Re-implemented clock().&nbsp; The new implementation uses the OS millisecond counter and is hence
 not susceptible to TZ changes.&nbsp; It is also smaller, faster and more accurate, although it may wrap around earlier than
 the original implementation.
<li>The disassembler (wdis) now correctly processes x86 'push 8-bit immediate' instructions.
<li>The disassembler now correctly processes absolute memory references.&nbsp; All memory references without fixup are now
 disassembled as ds:&#91;...&#93; or sreg:&#91;...&#93;.
<li>Several DirectX Win32 programming samples have been added.&nbsp; Note that a separate DirectX SDK (available from Microsoft)
 is required to build these sample programs.
</ul>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_1"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.1 </h2>
<br>Following is a list of changes made in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.2:
<ul>
<li>Handling of default libraries for Win32 targets has been changed.&nbsp; Previously default library records were included
 in the C runtime library, now they are specified part of the wlink Win32 target definitions in wlsystem.lnk.&nbsp; The list
 of libraries has changed from previous version as well and now reflects the Microsoft compiler defaults; existing IDE projects
 and makefiles may need to have additional libraries specified if those are no longer part of the default list.
<li>The C compiler now performs stricter checking on function prototypes and pointer operations.&nbsp; This may lead to previously
 undiagnosed warnings/errors appearing when compiling incorrect or ambiguous code.
<li>The C compiler diagnostic messages have been improved to print more information, making it easier to isolate the problem.
<li>A new warning (W130) has been added to the C compiler to diagnose possible precision loss on assignment operations.&nbsp;
 This warning is never on by default and must be enabled through '#pragma enable_message(130)' or '-wce=130' switch.
<li>Support for C99 style variable argument macros (and __VA_ARGS__) has been added to the C and C++ compilers.
<li>Added support for the __func__ symbol (name of the current function) which is equivalent to the already existing __FUNCTION__
 symbol.
<li>Better C99 style support for &quot;long long&quot; type is now available in the C and C++ compilers.&nbsp; LL, ULL and
 LLU suffixes are recognized for constants.&nbsp; &quot;long long int&quot; is now also recognized.
<li>Added C99 style *LLONG_MIN/MAX defines to limits.h.
<li>The C++ compiler has been fixed to properly accept source files where a template was the last item in a name space or
 an external linkage.
<li>Several new -adxx options have been added to the C and C++ compilers to support automatic generation of 'make' style dependency
 files.
<li>The C compiler has been fixed to correctly diagnose illegal union assignments.
<li>The C compiler now issues warnings on operations involving pointers to different but compatible unions.
<li>The C and C++ compilers now ensure word alignment of wide character string literals to satisfy Win32 API restrictions.
<li>The __UNIX__ macro is now supported in C and C++ compilers, wmake and wasm.&nbsp; It is currently defined for QNX and
 Linux targets.
<li>Default windowing support has been re-enabled for Win16 and Win386 runtime libraries.
<li>Since default windowing is no longer supported on most platforms, the Programmer's Guide and IDE tutorial have been updated
 to reflect that fact.
<li>The Win32 GUI tools now support the Windows XP look and feel.
<li>AutoCAD and MFC targets have been removed from the IDE, the -bw switch (default windowing) is no longer available in the
 IDE for OS/2 and Win32 targets.
<li>Manual for the CauseWay DOS extender has been added.
<li>The dmpobj tool has been added.&nbsp; This utility dumps the contents of OMF object files and can be useful to developers.
<li>Several system definitions have been added to wlink:&nbsp; os2_pm (16-bit OS/2 Presentation Manager executable), os2_dll
 (16-bit OS/2 DLL) and os2v2_dll (32-bit OS/2 DLL).
<li>The linker has been fixed to read &quot;AR&quot; style archives produced by third party tools.
<li>The linker has been fixed to prevent crashes when linking with COFF files providing uninitialized COMDAT entries
<li>Several linker crashes related to ELF object files and executables have been resolved.
<li>Updated wlink to call wlib with the -c (case sensitive) option when creating import libraries.&nbsp; This fixes problems
 with DLLs that export symbols differing only in case.
<li>The C runtime library has been optimized to produce smaller executables.
<li>The printf() function now supports the &quot;ll&quot; format specifier for &quot;long long&quot; integers.
<li>The printf() function has been enhanced to support %b format specifier for bitfields.
<li>Execution order of C library termination routines is now better defined to prevent instances where temporary files created
 through mktemp() could be left behind.
<li>&#91;OS/2 32-bit&#93; To prevent crashes, termination code is not run if second instance of a DLL failed to load due to
 single DGROUP.
<li>&#91;OS/2 32-bit&#93; The __grow_handles() function was incorrectly adding n requested handles to existing limit instead
 of setting the limit to n.
<li>&#91;OS/2 32-bit&#93; Fixed a problem with _STACKLOW in multithreaded programs and DLLs.&nbsp; This prevents crashes where
 Fortran DLLs would run out of stack.
<li>&#91;OS/2 16-bit&#93; Fixed default math exception handler which wasn't popping the FP status word off the stack and would
 therefore crash on exit.
<li>The Win32 Image Editor has been enhanced with drag-and-drop support.
<li>The IDE has been fixed to properly handle mixed case filenames.
<li>The Microsoft compatibility tools (NMAKE, CL) have been fixed to better handle command line arguments.
<li>The Dialog Editor (wde) has been fixed to prevent occasional DDE related crashes when run from inside the Resource Editor
 (wre).
<li>The 'Change font' option no longer crashes the GUI debugger (wdw).
<li>On OS/2, wdw now intercepts the F10 key instead of passing it on to the system.
<li>The code generator now deletes object files if it was interrupted.&nbsp; Previously zero-length invalid object files could
 be left behind, interfering with make operation.
<li>The wasm assembler has been enhanced to generate file dependency information usable by wmake.
<li>Numerous minor fixes have been made to wasm.
<li>Compatibility with MASM 6 has been improved with wasm.
<li>Support for sysenter and sysexit instructions has been added to wasm and wdis.
<li>Disassembly of xchg and bound instructions has been fixed in wdis (corrected order of operands).
<li>Several previously undocumented wmake directives have been documented.
<li>A -sn ('noisy') option has been added to wmake to print all commands that wmake executes, including silent ones.
<li>The w32api project has been updated to the latest version.
<li>The os2api project has been enhanced - added multimedia headers and libraries and numerous fixes have been made to the
 header files.
<li>The debugger now supports the F7 key as a shortcut for &quot;run to cursor&quot;.&nbsp; This is consistent with CodeView.
<li>New internal variable dbg$ntid (next thread id) has been added to the debugger.&nbsp; This permits automated iteration
 of all threads.
<li>The wsample tool has been updated to dynamically allocate storage for command line, where previously the command line
 length was limited to 128 characters.
<li>The FORTRAN compiler has been changed to preserve case of symbols with linkage other than FORTRAN.&nbsp; This is especially
 helpful when calling OS API functions and using case sensitive link step (now default).
</ul>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Open_Watcom_Version_1_0"> Differences from Open Watcom Version 1.0 </h2>
<br>A number of problems has been corrected in Open Watcom C/C++ 1.1.
<ul>
<li>Using the -ol option (loop optimization) sometimes resulted in generation of incorrect code.
<li>The<b><i> printf()</i></b> function could access too much data when formatting strings, causing page faults.
<li>NANs, INFs and denormals were not handled correctly by the math emulation library.
<li>The assembler did not generate implicit segment override prefixes when accessing data in code segment.
<li>The<b><i> clock()</i></b> function sometimes produced incorrect results on OS/2 if the<tt> TZ</tt> environment variable
 was set.
<li>The Open Watcom editor (vi/viw) has been changed to store temporary files in directory designated by the<tt> TMP</tt>
 environment variable, instead of using the<tt> TMPDIR</tt> environment variable.
<li>Many packaging problems (missing files) have been resolved.
</ul>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Version_11_0"> Differences from Version 11.0 </h2>
<br>Open Watcom C/C++ 1.0 is not substantially different from Watcom C/C++ version 11.0.&nbsp; There are however several changes
 that may require you to change your source and/or makefiles or project files.
<ul>
<li>The C compiler now implements stricter function prototype processing.&nbsp; This may result in new warning or error messages
 on code that was previously compiling cleanly but contained mismatches between function prototypes and actual definitions.
&nbsp; The C++ compiler did not have this problem.
<li>The linker now defaults to case sensitive symbol resolution.&nbsp; In most cases this is not a problem and may in fact
 avoid certain problems.&nbsp; If your project relies on case insensitive linking, please add<b><i> OPTION NOCASEEX</i></b>
 to your linker directives.
<li>Default windowing support has been removed from the runtime libraries.
<li>Components of the Win32 SDK and OS/2 Toolkits are no longer supplied.
<li>MFC libraries, source code and documentation are no longer supplied.
</ul>
<h2 id="Changes_in_11_0_that_may_Require_Recompilation"> Changes in 11.0 that may Require Recompilation </h2>
<br>Do not attempt to mix object code generated by earlier versions of the compilers with object code generated by this release
 or with the libraries provided in this release.
<br><br>A new C++ object model has been implemented.&nbsp; If you have undefined references to<tt> __wcpp_3_*</tt> names,
 you have old object code.&nbsp; If you have undefined references to<tt> __wcpp_4_*,</tt> you have old libraries and new object
 code.
<dl>
<dt>clock()
<dd>The<b><i> clock</i></b> function accuracy has changed from 100 ticks per second to 1000 ticks per second (i.e.,<b><i> CLOCKS_PER_SEC</i></b>
 has changed).&nbsp; Source code that uses the<b><i> clock</i></b> function and<b><i> CLOCKS_PER_SEC</i></b> in its calculations
 must be recompiled before linking the application with new libraries.

<h2 id="Major_Differences_from_Version_10_6"> Major Differences from Version 10.6 </h2>
<br>The following sections summarize the major differences from the previous release.
<ul>
<li>In general, we have improved Microsoft compatibility in our compilers (more warnings instead of errors, support for MS

</ul>
<h3 id="Changes_to_the_CPP_Compiler_for_11_0"> Changes to the C++ Compiler for 11.0 </h3>
<ul>
<li>The C++ compiler now optimizes empty base-classes to occupy zero storage in the derived class memory layout.&nbsp; The
 C++ Working Paper recently allowed this optimization to be performed by conforming implementations.&nbsp; Furthermore, the
 optimization has speed and size benefits.&nbsp; There are certain classes of (broken) C++ programs that may not function
 properly with the new optimization.&nbsp; If you explicitly memset() an empty base class, you will be clearing memory that
 you may not expect to be cleared since the &quot;zero sized&quot; base class in actual fact shares storage with the first
 member of the derived class.&nbsp; A memset() of the entire derived class is fine though.
<li>We have added support for the<tt> mutable</tt> keyword which is used to indicate data members that can be modified even
 if you have a<b> const</b> pointer to the class.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mutable int x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo() const;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void S::foo() const {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = 1;&nbsp; // OK since it is mutable</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We have added support for the<tt> bool</tt> type along with<tt> true</tt> and<tt> false.</tt>
<li>We have added support for the<tt> explicit</tt> attribute.&nbsp; It marks a constructor so that it will not be considered
 for overloading during implicit conversions.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explicit S( int );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S v = 1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // error; cannot convert 'int' to 'S'</tt>
<br><br>Suppose the class was changed as follows:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explicit S(int );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S( char );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S v = 1;&nbsp; // OK; S( char ) is called</tt>
<br><br>The fact that<tt> S(int)</tt> is not considered leaves<tt> S(char)</tt> as the only way to satisfy the implicit conversion.
<li>We have added support for name spaces.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; namespace x {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // anything that can go in file-scope</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; namespace {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // anything in here is local to your module!</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><br>In the above example, you can access names in the namespace &quot;x&quot; by &quot;x::&quot; scoping.&nbsp; Alternatively,
 you can use the &quot;using namespace x&quot; statement (thereby eliminating the need for &quot;x::&quot; scoping).&nbsp;
 You can include a part of the namespace into the current scope with the &quot;using x::member&quot; statement.&nbsp; (also
 eliminating the need for &quot;x::&quot; scoping).
<ol>
<li>Name spaces eliminate the hand mangling of names.&nbsp; For example, instead of prefixing names with a distinguishing
 string like &quot;XPQ_&quot; (e.g., XPQ_Lookup), you can put the names in a namespace called &quot;XPQ&quot;.
<li>Name spaces allow for private names in a module.&nbsp; This is most useful for types which are used in a single module.
<li>Name spaces encourage the meaningful classification of implementation components.&nbsp; For example, code-generation components
 might reside in a namespace called &quot;CodeGen&quot;.
</ol>
<li>We have added support for RTTI (Run-Time Type Information).
<li>We have added support for the new C++ cast notation.&nbsp; It allows you to use less powerful casts that the all powerful
 C-style cast and to write more meaningful code.&nbsp; The idea is to eliminate explicit casts by using a more meaningful
 new-style cast.&nbsp; The new C++ casts are:
<br><br><b><i>reinterpret_cast</i></b><b> &lt; type-id &gt;(expr)</b>
<br><br><b><i>const_cast</i></b><b> &lt; type-id &gt;( expr )</b>
<br><b><i>static_cast</i></b><b> &lt; type-id &gt;( expr )</b>
<br><b><i>dynamic_cast</i></b><b> &lt; type-id &gt;( expr )</b> (part of RTTI)
<li>We have improved (faster) pre-compiled header support.
<li>We have added &quot;long long&quot; (64-bit integer) support in the form of a new<b> __int64</b> type.
<li>The default structure packing was changed from &quot;zp1&quot; to &quot;zp2&quot; in the 16-bit compiler and from &quot;zp1&quot;
 to &quot;zp8&quot; in the 32-bit compiler.
<li>The default type of debugging information that is included in object files is &quot;Dwarf&quot;.&nbsp; It used to be &quot;Watcom&quot;.
<li>A new double-byte string processing option has been added (zkl).&nbsp; When this option is specified, the local or current
 code page character set is used to decide if the compiler should process strings as if they might contain double-byte characters.
</ul>

<li>We support Microsoft-compatible in-line assembly formats using the &quot;_asm&quot; keyword.
<li>A new optimization, &quot;branch prediction&quot;, has been added.&nbsp; This optimization is enabled by the &quot;ob&quot;
 or &quot;ox&quot; compiler options.&nbsp; The code generator tries to increase the density of cache use by predicting branches
 based upon heuristics (this optimization is especially important for Intel's Pentium Pro).
<li>We have added Multi-media Extensions (MMX) support to the in-line assemblers.

<h3 id="Changes_to_the_Compiler_Tools_for_11_0"> Changes to the Compiler Tools for 11.0 </h3>
<ul>
<li>The Open Watcom Linker supports incremental linking.
<li>The Open Watcom Linker can now process COFF and ELF format object files, as well as OMF et al.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Linker
 can now read both AR-format (Microsoft compatible) libraries and old-style OMF libraries.
<li>Support for creating 16-bit DOS overlaid executables has been removed from the linker.
<li>The Open Watcom Library Manager (WLIB) can now process COFF and ELF format object files, as well as OMF et al.&nbsp; The
 Open Watcom Library Manager can now read/write both AR-format (Microsoft compatible) libraries and old-style OMF libraries.
&nbsp; The default output format is AR-format and this can be changed by switches.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Library Manager can
 output various format import libraries.
<li>We have added Multi-media Extensions (MMX) support to the Open Watcom Assembler (WASM).
<li>A new version of the Open Watcom Disassembler (WDIS) can disassemble Intel or Alpha AXP object code files.&nbsp; It can
 process ELF, COFF or OMF object files and ELF, COFF or PE format (Win32) executables.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Disassembler
 looks at image file being input to determine the processor-type (defaults to Intel).
<br><br>The old disassembler (WDISASM) has been retired and is not included in the package.
<li>We have added new tool front-ends that emulate Microsoft tools.&nbsp; These are:
<ul>
<li>nmake
<li>cl
<li>link
<li>lib
<li>rc
<li>cvtres
</ul>
<br>These programs take the usual Microsoft arguments and translate them, where possible, into equivalent Open Watcom arguments
 and spawn the equivalent Open Watcom tools.
<li>Open Watcom Make now processes Microsoft format makefiles when the &quot;ms&quot; option is used.
</ul>
<h3 id="Changes_to_the_CDCPP_Libraries_for_11_0"> Changes to the C/C++ Libraries for 11.0 </h3>

<li>A &quot;commit&quot; flag (&quot;c&quot;) was added to the fopen()<b> mode</b> argument.
<li>The global translation mode flag default is &quot;text&quot; unless you explicitly link your program with<tt> BINMODE.OBJ.</tt>
<li>Processing of the &quot;0&quot; flag in the format string for the printf() family of functions has been corrected such
 that when a precision is specified, the &quot;0&quot; flag is ignored.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf( &quot;%09.3lf\n&quot;, 1.34242 ); // &quot;0&quot; flag is ignored</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf( &quot;%09lf\n&quot;, 1.34242 ); // &quot;0&quot; flag is not ignored</tt>
<li>Support for printing<b> __int64</b> values was added to<b><i> printf</i></b> and related functions.
<li>Support for scanning<b> __int64</b> values was added to<b><i> scanf</i></b> and related functions.

<br>We have improved Microsoft compatibility so that Win32 SDK and MFC header files can be compiled without change.&nbsp;
 The following changes were required to support Win32 SDK header files.
<ul>
<li>We recognize the single underscore versions of<tt> __stdcall, __inline,</tt> and<tt> __fastcall</tt> keywords.
<li>The<tt> _fastcall</tt> and<tt> __fastcall</tt> keywords are scanned but ignored since they refer to a particular Microsoft
 code generation technique.&nbsp; Open Watcom's generated code is always &quot;fast&quot;.
</ul>
<br>The following changes were required to support MFC source code.
<ul>
<li>When /bt=DOS is specified, define<tt> _DOS.</tt>
<li>When /bt=WINDOWS is specified, define<tt> _WINDOWS.</tt>

</ul>
<br>The compiler now supports the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).&nbsp; This library is available at the ftp site &quot;butler.hpl.hp.com&quot;.
&nbsp; When compiling applications that use the STL, you must use the &quot;hd&quot; compiler option for debugging info (the
 &quot;hw&quot; option causes too much debug information to be generated).

<li>We have added the &quot;t&lt;number&gt;&quot; option to the C++ compiler to set the number of spaces in a tab stop (for
 column numbers in error messages).
<li>The C compiler now supports @filename on the command line like the C++ compiler currently does.
<li>The &quot;__stdcall&quot; linkage convention has changed.&nbsp; All C symbols (extern &quot;C&quot; symbols in C++) are
 now suffixed by &quot;@nnn&quot; where &quot;nnn&quot; is the sum of the argument sizes (each size is rounded up to a multiple
 of 4 bytes so that char and short are size 4).&nbsp; When the argument list contains &quot;...&quot;, the &quot;@nnn&quot;
 suffix is omitted.&nbsp; This was done for compatibility with Microsoft.&nbsp; Use the &quot;zz&quot; option for backwards
 compatibility.
<li>The 32-bit &quot;__cdecl&quot; linkage convention has changed.&nbsp; Watcom C/C++ 10.0 __cdecl did not match the Microsoft
 Visual C++ __cdecl in terms of the binary calling convention; Visual C++ saves EBX in a __cdecl function but Watcom C/C++
 10.0 modified EBX.&nbsp; Watcom C/C++ has been changed to match Visual C/C++.
<br><br>If you wrote a &quot;__cdecl&quot; function in an earlier version of Watcom C/C++, the EBX register was not saved/restored.
&nbsp; Starting with release 10.5, the EBX register will be saved/restored in the prologue/epilogue of a &quot;__cdecl&quot;
 function.
<br><br>Another implication of this change is that &quot;__cdecl&quot; functions compiled with an earlier version of Watcom
 C/C++ don't match the calling conventions of the current version.&nbsp; The solution is either to recompile the functions
 or to define a &quot;__cdecl_old&quot; pragma that matches the old calling conventions.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma aux __cdecl_old &quot;_*&quot; \</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parm caller &#91;&#93;
 \</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value struct float
 struct routine &#91;eax&#93; \</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify &#91;eax ebx
 ecx edx&#93;;</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma aux (__cdecl_old) foo;</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern int foo( int a, int b );</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void main()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, foo( 1, 2 ) );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We now allow:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern &quot;C&quot; int __cdecl x;</tt>
<br><br>It must be<tt> extern &quot;C&quot;</tt> for<tt> __cdecl</tt> to take effect since variables have their type mangled
 into the name for &quot;C++&quot; linkage.
<li>In C++, we have removed the warning for &quot;always true/false&quot; expressions if the sub-expressions are constant
 values.
<li>We have added support for:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma pack(push,4);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma pack(push);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma pack(pop)</tt>
<li>We have added support for:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma comment(lib,&quot;mylib.lib&quot;)</tt>
<br><br>which has the same semantics as:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma library( &quot;mylib.lib&quot; )</tt>
<li>We have added support for expanding macros in the code_seg/data_seg pragmas:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define DATA_SEG_NAME &quot;MYDATA&quot;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define CODE_SEG_NAME &quot;MYCODE&quot;</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma data_seg( DATA_SEG_NAME )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x = 3;</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma code_seg( CODE_SEG_NAME )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int fn() {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We have fixed the 16-bit compiler so that it matches the Microsoft 16-bit C compiler for the following cases:
<ul>
<li>If a pascal function is defined when compiling for Windows 3.x, use the fat Windows 3.x prologue in the function.
<li>If a cdecl function is defined when compiling for Windows 3.x, use the fat Windows 3.x prologue in the function.
</ul>
<li>We have fixed the compiler so that
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #include &lt;/dir/file.h&gt;</tt>
<br><br>works as expected (it was searching along the INCLUDE path only).
<li>In C++, we have fixed a problem where an import was generated in the object file for a virtual function call.&nbsp; This
 will reduce the size of executables under certain circumstances.
<li>In C++, we have removed the prohibition of pointer to array of unknown size declarations.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int (*p)&#91;&#93;;</tt>
<li>In C++, we have fixed the diagnosis of lexical problems during macro expansion to remove spurious warnings.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define stringize( x )&nbsp; #x</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stringize( 2131231236172637126371273612763612731 )</tt>
<li>We have corrected the check for too many bytes in #pragma for assembler style aux #pragmas.
<li>Undeclared class names in elaborated class specifiers are now declared in the nearest enclosing non-class scope.&nbsp;
 Undeclared classes are also allowed in arguments now.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // used to declared ::S::N but now declares ::N</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct N *p;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo( struct Z *p );&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // declares ::Z</tt>
<li>We have fixed unduly harsh restriction on virtual ...-style functions.&nbsp; They are now allowed in single inheritance
 hierarchies as long as the return type is not changed when the virtual function is overridden.&nbsp; In multiple inheritance
 hierarchies, an implementation restriction is still present for generating a 'this' adjustment thunk for virtual functions.
<li>We have fixed line number information for multi-line statement expressions in some weird cases.
<li>We have fixed function template parsing of user-defined conversions that use an uninstantiated class in their operator
 name.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void ack( int );</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class T&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S( T x )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ack( x );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class T&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct W {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; operator S&lt;T&gt;();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class T&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W&lt;T&gt;::operator S&lt;T&gt;() {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We have fixed a compiler problem that caused a linker warning &quot;lazy reference for &lt;virtual-fn&gt; has different
 default resolutions&quot; in cases where the compiler or programmer optimized virtual function calls to direct calls in modules
 that also contained virtual calls.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T.H</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int foo() { return __LINE__; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct T : S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int foo() { return __LINE__; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T1.CPP</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #include &quot;t.h&quot;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Q : T {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int foo() { return S::foo() + __LINE__;
 }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo( T *p )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q y;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y.foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-&gt;foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T2.CPP</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #include &quot;t.h&quot;</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo( T *p );</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void ack( T *p ) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-&gt;foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foo(p);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main() {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T q;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ack( &amp;q );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>When a class value is returned and is immediately (in the same expression) used to call a member function, the value may
 not be stored in memory.
<br><br>Work around:&nbsp; introduce a temporary
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int v;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int member();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S foo();</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void example( void )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // foo().member();&nbsp; // replace this line with:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S temp = foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temp.member();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>Throwing pointers to functions did not work when the size of a function pointer is greater than the size of a data pointer.
<br><br>Work around:&nbsp; place the function pointer in a class and throw the class object.
<li>We have fixed default argument processing for const references to an abstract class.&nbsp; The following example would
 not compile properly:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct A {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual int foo() = 0;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &amp;foo();</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void ack( A const &amp;r = foo() );</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void bar() {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ack();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We have made &quot;DllMain&quot; default to extern &quot;C&quot; linkage for Microsoft Visual C++ compatibility.
<li>We have duplicated a Microsoft Visual C++ extension that was required to parse the Windows 95 SDK header files.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } S, const *CSP;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^^^- not allowed in ISO C or ISO C++</tt>
<li>We now do not warn about starting a nested comment if the comment is just about to end.
<br><br>We also fixed the code that figures out where a comment was started so that a nested comment warning is more helpful.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*/////////*/</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^-</tt>
<li>We have fixed a problem where extra informational notes were not being printed for the error message that exceeded the
 error message limit.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // compile -e2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo( S const *p )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-&gt;foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-&gt;foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-&gt;foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-&gt;foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We have fixed a problem where the line number for an error message was incorrect.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo() const;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void bar();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void S::foo() const</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar();</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this-&gt;bar();</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We have fixed output of browser information for instantiated function template typedefs.
<li>We have upgraded the C++ parser so that casts and member pointer dereferences can appear on the left hand side of the
 assignment expression without parentheses.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p-&gt;*mp = 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (int&amp;)x = 1;</tt>
<li>In several cases, when a function return or a construction was immediately dotted in an expression, the generated code
 was incorrect:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern S gorf();</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void bar()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gorf().foo();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><br>The work around was to break the statement in two:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S temp = gorf();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temp.foo();</tt>
<li>In several cases, when a function return or a construction was immediately addressed in an expression, the generated code
 was incorrect:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern void fun( S* );</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern S gorf();</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void bar()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fun( &amp;gorf() );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><br>The work around was to break the statement in two:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S temp = gorf();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fun( &amp;temp );</tt>
<li>We have added support for:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #pragma error &quot;error message&quot;</tt>
<br><br>Use the ISO/ANSI method because it is more portable and acceptable (Microsoft header files use the less portable #pragma
 when there is a perfectly fine, portable way to issue a message).
<br><br>The portable, acceptable method is:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #error &quot;error message&quot;</tt>
<li>We have added support for<tt> __declspec(dllexport), __declspec(dllimport), __declspec(thread),</tt> and<tt> __declspec(naked)</tt>
 for Win32 (i.e., WinNT 3.5 and Win95) programs.&nbsp; Here are some examples:
<br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __declspec(dllexport) int a;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // export 'a'
 variable</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __declspec(dllexport) int b()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // export 'b' function</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct __declspec(dllexport) S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static int a;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // export 'a' static member</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void b();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // export 'b' member fn</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern __declspec(dllimport) int a; // import 'a' from a .DLL</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern __declspec(dllimport) int b();//import 'b' from a .DLL</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct __declspec(dllimport) I {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static int a;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // import 'a' static member</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void b();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // import 'b' member fn</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<li>The C++ compiler generates better error messages for in-class initializations and pure virtual functions.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct S {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static int const a = 0;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static int const b = 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo() = 0;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void bar() = 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual void ack() = 0;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtual void sam() = 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</tt>
<li>We have fixed macro processing code so that the following program compiles correctly.&nbsp; The compiler was not treating
 &quot;catch&quot; as a keyword after the expansion of &quot;catch_all&quot;.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define catch(n) catch(n &amp;exception)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define xall (...)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define catch_all catch xall</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main()</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch_all{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<li>We have fixed a problem where<tt> #pragma code_seg</tt> caused a page fault in the compiler when the code_seg was empty.
<li>We have fixed a rare problem where a #include of a file that was previously included caused the primary source file to

</ol>
<br>You should not continue to use .cfg files from the Limited Availability version of the compiler.&nbsp; Several new features
 have been added.&nbsp; Using the old files will cause problems.
<br><br>The C++ compiler calling conventions have changed.&nbsp; Any program that passes a &quot;data only&quot; class or
 struct as a parameter, or returns a C++ object will need to be recompiled.&nbsp; We recommend that you recompile your application.
<br><br>The C++ compiler now supports the use of the<b><i> __export</i></b> ,<b><i> __cdecl</i></b> ,<b><i> __pascal</i></b>

 should not require recompilation, but<b> you should recompile your application if you want to take full advantage new features
 in the debugger.</b>&nbsp; The changes to the C++ object model are:

<li>OS/2 libraries modified so that single library supports single and multiple threads and DLL's
<li>&quot;fpi287&quot; switch renamed to &quot;fp2&quot;
<li>#pragma intrinsic and #pragma function added
<li>80x87 usage modified so that compiler assumes all eight registers are available upon entry to function instead of only
 four registers.&nbsp; &quot;fpr&quot; option added for reverse compatibility with object files compiled with previous versions
 of compiler
</ul>
<h3 id="Changes_that_may_Require_Recompilation"> Changes that may Require Recompilation </h3>
<br>The<b> stat</b> structure in &quot;stat.h&quot; changed in version 9.5.&nbsp; Any object files compiled with an earlier
 version of the compiler will have to be recompiled if they use the stat structure.
<br><br>A new function<b> _grow_handles</b> was added to version 9.5 for growing the number of available file handles.&nbsp;
 Details on how to use this function can be found in the<b> Watcom C/C++32 Commonly Asked Questions &amp; Answers</b> booklet.
<br><br>If you compile with structure packing (/zp2, /zp4, /zp8) or use the &quot;pack&quot; pragma to specify a packing value
 other than 1, and you have structures that contain other structures, field offsets and structure sizes may be different depending
 on the contents of the structures.
<br><br>In version 9.01, the new Windows Supervisor now has 32 user-defined callbacks.&nbsp; If you have any user-defined
 callbacks in your Windows program, you must recompile because the constant definitions have changed.
<br><br>In version 9.0, the compiler will not use FS by default to avoid conflicts with new operating systems (OS/2 2.0, PenPoint,
 Windows NT).&nbsp; This will cause compile errors if you have defined a pragma that uses the FS register.
<br><br>In version 8.5, the compiler was changed so that it by default does not save and restore segment registers across
 function calls.&nbsp; This is to solve problems that occur where a segment register is saved and restored in a function that
 tries to free the segment.&nbsp; When the segment register is popped from the stack in the epilogue, a general protection
 exception occurs because the selector is no longer valid.&nbsp; In order to provide backward compatibility with existing
 code, we have added a &quot;-r&quot; option that will cause the compiler to save and restore segment registers across calls.
&nbsp; The C run-time library has been compiled with the &quot;-r&quot; option so that it will work should you choose to compile
 your application with the same option.
<br><br>The packing algorithm was also changed in version 8.5.&nbsp; If you are using one of the &quot;-zp2, -zp4, or -zp8&quot;
 options to pack structures, you must recompile your application.&nbsp; The packing algorithm has been changed so that the
 minimum number of slack bytes are inserted into structures to align fields onto their required alignment.

<h1 id="TroubleMShooting"> Trouble-Shooting </h1>
<br>This section is intended to provide you with help on some of the common (and not so common) problems that users have encountered
 when trying to run the software.
<dl>
<dt>Symptom:
<dd>The message &quot;Cannot connect to batch spawn server&quot; is displayed.
<dt><br>Resolution:
<dd>This message occurs when the Open Watcom IDE is trying to connect to the batch server.&nbsp; The batch server is a program
 that is employed by the Open Watcom IDE to run &quot;makes&quot; in the background.&nbsp; There are several reasons why you
 may receive this message.
<ul>
<li><b> Installing Under the Host System and Selecting &quot;Modify System Files&quot; During Install</b>
<br><br>For the IDE to run properly under a particular host operating system, the install program must be run on that system.
<br><br>It is very important to check the &quot;Modify System Files&quot; when running the install on the host platform.&nbsp;
 Otherwise, changes required in the host system's environment will not be made.&nbsp; If this is the problem, you should re-install
 under the host environment and select this option.
<li><b> System stability</b>
<br><br>If for some reason the operating system has become unstable, the IDE may have trouble connecting to the batch server.
&nbsp; This can happen if you have run a badly behaved application that caused an exception, for example a page fault.&nbsp;
 If this is the problem, you should shutdown the operating system and reboot.
<li><b> Running Windows 3.1 in Enhanced Mode</b>
<br><br>The IDE requires at least version 3.1 of Windows to be running, in enhanced mode.&nbsp; Windows 3.0 is not supported.
</ul>
</dl>
<br><b>Running Third-Party Shell Programs</b>
<br><br>If you run 4DOS.COM or some other shell besides COMMAND.COM, you must change the &quot;BATCHBOX.PIF&quot; file accordingly.
&nbsp; You can do this using the standard Windows PIF editor.
<br><br><b>Running Virus Checkers</b>
<br><br>If you are running Central Point's PCTOOLS, VWATCH, or some other virus checker, it may be conflicting with our batch
 server.&nbsp; To isolate the problem, uninstall the virus checker and see if the IDE works again.
<br><br><b>386 Enhanced &quot;Exclusive in Foreground&quot; Option</b>
<br><br>If you go to the Windows Control Panel, &quot;Scheduling Options&quot; of &quot;386 Enhanced&quot;, and the &quot;Exclusive
 in Foreground&quot; checkbox is checked, uncheck it.&nbsp; This causes our batch server to starve under Windows.
<br><br><b>Changes to the SYSTEM.INI File</b>
<br><br>The WDEBUG.386 driver is required to be installed in the &#91;386Enh&#93; section of SYSTEM.INI.&nbsp; This should
 have been done automatically by the WATCOM install program when the software was installed under the host environment and
 the &quot;modify system files&quot; option was selected.
<br><br>It has been reported that the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OverlappedIO=on</tt>
<br><br>not appear in the SYSTEM.INI file.
<br><br>It appears the user's problem was related to conflicts with other devices installed in the SYSTEM.INI file.&nbsp;
 On its own, the above line does not appear to affect the execution of the IDE.
<br><br>It has been reported that the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NoEMMDriver=ON</tt>
<br><br>not appear in the SYSTEM.INI file.&nbsp; It will prevent a link from succeeding in the IDE.
<h2 id="WinMOSD2_and_OSD2_Specific"> Win-OS/2 and OS/2 Specific </h2>
<br><b>Installing for a Win-OS/2 Host</b>
<br><br>For Win-OS/2, the install must be run under OS/2 and &quot;Modify System Files&quot; must be selected.&nbsp; This
 installs the batch server under OS/2, which we require under Win-OS/2.&nbsp; Then the Windows install program should be run
 under Win-OS/2 so that the program groups will be created.&nbsp; &quot;Modify System Files&quot; should also be checked for
 the Win-OS/2 install.
<br><br><b>Named Pipe Conflicts</b>
<br><br>Under OS/2, the batch server is a named pipe.&nbsp; Win-OS/2 uses the OS/2 named pipe for the batch server, hence
 the OS/2 IDE will conflict with the Win-OS/2 IDE if they are both running.&nbsp; If this is the problem, you should run only
 one of the OS/2 and Win-OS/2 IDE, not both at the same time.
