<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Resource_Editor"> The Open Watcom Resource Editor </h1>
<br>The Open Watcom Resource Editor is a full-featured editor that enables you to easily create and edit resources and the
 files that contain them.&nbsp; A file containing one or more resources will generally be referred to as a resource file.
&nbsp; A resource file may be an executable (.EXE), resource file (.RES), dynamic link library (.DLL), bitmap file (.BMP),
 cursor file (.CUR), or icon file (.ICO).&nbsp; The editor also supports a variety of resource scripts.&nbsp; They include
 dialog (.DLG), accelerator (.ACC), menu (.MNU), and string (.STR) scripts.&nbsp; This support is accomplished by maintaining
 a synchronized resource file (.RES) in the same directory as the resource script.&nbsp; Opening a resource file reveals a
 Resource window in the Resource Editor window.&nbsp; This window is a visual representation of the resource file.
<br><br>A resource is a piece of data with a specific format that Windows uses to create the visual and interactive elements
 of your application.&nbsp; Most of the visual aspects of Windows applications are the result of the application having resources,
 all of which can be created using the Open Watcom Resource Editor.&nbsp; Use the Resource Editor to create and edit the following
 resource types:
<ul>
<li>Accelerators
<li>Bitmaps
<li>Cursors
<li>Dialogs
<li>Icons
<li>Menus
<li>Strings
</ul>
<br>When designing your application's user interface, the resources are separate from the application's source code.&nbsp;
 This makes changing the user interface a simple task.&nbsp; Instead of accessing the application's source code, you can make
 the changes directly to the resources.&nbsp; You can manipulate some aspects of the resources, such as the memory flags and
 resource names, without invoking the resource's associated editor.&nbsp; Invoking the desired editor from the Resource Editor
 enables you to change all aspects of the selected resource.
<br><br>Different applications often use the same or similar resources, such as bitmaps, icons, dialogs, and menus.&nbsp;
 The Resource Editor enables you to create resource files for a new application by reusing existing resources.&nbsp; Copying
 a resource from existing applications into the new resource file makes the task of creating your user interface quick and
 simple.
