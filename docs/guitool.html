<h1 id="Open_Watcom_Integrated_Development_Environment"> Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment </h1>
<br>Software development normally involves managing a number of different files for each project.&nbsp; A project often includes
 multiple source files, include files, and libraries.&nbsp; In addition, there are usually several programming tools involved:
&nbsp; compilers, linkers, preprocessors, debuggers, editors, and so on.&nbsp; But this is likely not new to you.&nbsp; What
 will be new is the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
<br><br>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment is a software development tool that manages project files and language
 tools.&nbsp; Although it is really a tool itself, the common term to describe it (and possibly the best analogy) is<b> Development
 Environment.</b>&nbsp; By using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, you have direct access to each of the
 files relating to a project and all of the language tools you require to build your application.
<br><br><img src="ide_s.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle">
<h2 id="How_the_Environment_Operates"> How the Environment Operates </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment has a graphical interface that combines file management and tool management.
&nbsp; An IDE session deals with a<b> Project.</b>&nbsp; A project can be generally defined as the collection of files and
 necessary information that relates to the development of project components.&nbsp; However, a project is more than just a
 graphical representation of a file list-it contains all of the underlying smarts to understand the interrelation of all files
 associated with the project and to ensure that these files are up-to-date.
<br><br>Each project component is referred to as a<b> Target.</b>&nbsp; An Integrated Development Environment target is made
 up of the source files, include files, libraries, and MAKE instructions to create the target file (for example, &quot;.exe&quot;,
 &quot;.dll&quot;, &quot;.lib&quot;, or &quot;.hlp&quot;).&nbsp; A project often has more than one target.&nbsp; Each target
 can be set to create the associated target file for a specific destination platform.
<br><br>Within a target, there are<b> Sources.</b>&nbsp; A source is an individual file (such as a &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.cpp&quot;
 file, but it can also be a &quot;.bmp&quot;, &quot;.rc&quot;, or &quot;.lib&quot; file) used to create the target file.&nbsp;
 A target usually has more than one source.
<h2 id="How_the_Integrated_Development_Environment_Looks"> How the Integrated Development Environment Looks </h2>
<br>In the following illustration, the main window is the project window for a project entitled<tt> first.wpj.</tt>&nbsp;
 The sub-window represents the target for this project,<tt> target1.exe.</tt>&nbsp; The source file for the target is listed
 within the target window.&nbsp; In this project, there is only a single target with a single source file.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide1.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 1.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom IDE window displays project and target windows.</b>
<br><br>The language tools are available on the toolbar and the drop-down menus.&nbsp; For example, on the Sources menu, you
 can work with the source that is selected in the target window.&nbsp; Here you can add a new source, remove or rename an
 existing source, edit a source, and so on.&nbsp; A similar set of target actions are available in the Targets menu and project
 actions are located in the File menu.
<br><br>A single IDE session displays a project.&nbsp; If the project consists of a number of components, such as two executables
 and one library, these appear as target sub-windows on the project window.&nbsp; Each target window displays the files necessary
 to construct the target and associates files with a rule describing the construction mechanism based on filename extension.
&nbsp; For example, a filename with the extension &quot;.exe&quot; may associate with the rule for constructing executables,
 or a filename with the extension &quot;.lib&quot; may associate with the rule for constructing static libraries.
<br><br>Different projects can refer to the same target.&nbsp; If they do, either project can manipulate the shared target
 and any changes to either project affect the shared target.
<h2 id="The_Files_the_Integrated_Development_Environment_Uses"> The Files the Integrated Development Environment Uses </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment creates and manages a project, referencing a number of targets.&nbsp;
 The IDE uses filename extensions to represent projects and targets.&nbsp; The extension &quot;.wpj&quot; represents projects
 and the extension &quot;.tgt&quot; represents targets.&nbsp; The IDE compiles and links the target in the target directory.
<br><br>The project file (.wpj) contains the names of all of the target files related to the project, including housekeeping
 information about the project and the current IDE session.
<br><br>Each target file (.tgt) describes one target and includes the name and type of the target executable, a reference
 to a rule describing how to build the target, and a list of relevant switches the rule uses.&nbsp; In addition, target files
 also contain the names of all of the source files used to construct the target program, references to similar rules for compiling
 them, and relevant switches.
<br><br>In constructing targets, the Integrated Development Environment references a list of rules defined in a configuration
 file, called<tt> ide.cfg.</tt>&nbsp; Each rule defines a command line used to do the construction and a list of actions you
 can perform on the target program (such as make, run, or debug) or on the files in the item list (such as make or edit).
&nbsp; Additionally, rules refer to tools.
<br><br>Tools define which command line switches you can use in the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment.

<h2 id="Getting_Started_with_a_Short_Tutorial"> Getting Started with a Short Tutorial </h2>
<br>Perhaps the easiest way to understand how the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment manages an entire project's
 files and tools, is to work through a brief example.&nbsp; In this walk-through, you create and execute a simple C program
 using the IDE.&nbsp; FORTRAN developers can follow along substituting FORTRAN code and file names where appropriate.&nbsp;
 The session will help you understand the basic concepts of the IDE and the steps involved in project development.
<br><br>The illustrations shown in this section are taken from the Windows environment.&nbsp; The OS/2 environment is very
 similar with some minor differences.&nbsp; For example, in the OS/2 environment the IDE uses the OS/2 Editor rather than
 Open Watcom's Windows Editor.&nbsp; Although this tutorial builds a Win32 executable, you can choose to build a Win16 or
 OS/2 PM executable.&nbsp; The procedures to follow are not that much different.&nbsp; When the time comes to select the type
 of target, simply choose an environment that you can run on your machine so that you can run your application to make sure
 it works.

<br><br>For the OS/2 IDE, you can add multiple source files to the target at one time by inserting a space between each filename
 you enter.&nbsp; You can also use the file browser to add files by clicking on the Browse...&nbsp; button.
<br><br>For all other systems, you can enter the names of the source files (with extensions) in the File Name field or you
 can use the file browser to select files.&nbsp; The type of files displayed in file list window can be controlled by modifying
 the List Files of Type field.&nbsp; Once you have typed a name in the File Name field or selected a name from the file list,
 you can add it to the list of source files to be included by clicking the Add button.&nbsp; All files in the file list can
 be added by clicking the Add All button.&nbsp; Individual names can be removed from the &quot;add&quot; list by selecting

<br>The Integrated Development Environment organizes the source files in the target window under headers according to the
 filename extension.&nbsp; You can expand and collapse the file groups by clicking on the folder icon.
<br><br>For this tutorial, we only need one source file, so now we will delete the extra files from the target.
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Click on the file</b><tt> source2.c</tt> (or<tt> source2.for</tt>) to select it then choose Remove Source from the Sources
 menu.
<br>A message box appears asking if you want to remove the selected source.&nbsp; Click on the Yes button to continue.&nbsp;
 The IDE removes the selected source file from the target window.&nbsp; Now we can remove<tt> source3.rc.</tt>&nbsp; To do
 this we will perform the function of removing all source files with a common extension.
<dt><br>(8)
<dd><b> Click on the (.rc) header</b> on the target window then choose Remove Source from the Sources menu.
<br>A message box appears on the screen asking if you want to remove all of the &quot;.rc&quot; files.&nbsp; Click on the
 Yes button to continue.&nbsp; The message box closes and the IDE removes the<tt> source3.rc</tt> file from the target window.
&nbsp; Now you can edit the remaining source file.
<dt><br>(9)
<dd><b> Highlight the line</b><tt> source1.c</tt> (or<tt> source1.for</tt>) and choose Edit Text from the Sources menu to edit
 the selected source file.
<br>The Open Watcom Editor appears.&nbsp; The name of the selected source file,<tt> source1.c</tt> (or<tt> source1.for</tt>),
 appears in the window.&nbsp; Here you can enter the source code.
<br><br><b><i>Hint:</i></b>&nbsp; You can also invoke the Open Watcom Editor by double-clicking on the source file that you
 want to edit.
<br><br>In this case, the Open Watcom Editor appears because the selected source file has a &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.for&quot;
 extension.&nbsp; Performing an edit can open different editors, depending on the extension of the selected source file.
<dt><br>(10)
<dd><b> Enter the following lines of source code.</b>

<br><br>You can now save your work and close the Editor in one of the following two ways:&nbsp; close down the entire editor
 or close down only the source file window.&nbsp; For this exercise, close only the source file window as follows.
<dt><br>(11)
<dd><b> Choose Close</b> from the File menu to close down the current source file window.
<br>In both cases, if changes have been made to the file and not saved, a message prompts you to save the changes before exiting.
&nbsp; The advantage of closing only the Editor window is that the Editor continues to run.&nbsp; If you need to access it
 again, you will not need to wait for it to go through the start-up procedures again.
<dl>
<dt>Important:
<dd>You must save the file.&nbsp; The Open Watcom compilers do not access the source lines in the Editor's buffers.
</dl>
<dt><br>(12)
<dd><b> Minimize the Editor window.</b>
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Click on the Open Watcom IDE Project window</b> to bring it to the foreground.
<dt><br>(13)
<dd><b> Choose Refresh</b> from the Window menu.
<br>This action forces the IDE to update the display with the state of all files.&nbsp; It is not necessary to use this function
 if you have selected Auto Refresh in the File menu.&nbsp; If Auto Refresh is disabled then it may be necessary to alert the
 IDE of the presence of the file on disk.&nbsp; 
<dt><br>(14)
<dd><b> Choose Save Project</b> from the File menu to save your project up to this point.
<br>You are now ready to make and run the target.&nbsp; Making a target is the act of constructing a target file.&nbsp; In
 this case, it involves compiling the source file<tt> source1.c</tt> (or<tt> source1.for</tt>) using the appropriate Open
 Watcom compiler and linking the target executable using the Open Watcom Linker.
<dt><br>(15)

<br><b><i>Figure 10.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Run from the Targets menu runs the target.</b>
<br><br>The program you wrote is a character mode application and its output appears in a separate console window.&nbsp; You
 are now ready to debug your target program.&nbsp; You probably do not need to debug this simple program with the Open Watcom
 Debugger but go through the steps so that you know what to do for more complex programs.
<br><br>The IDE has several debugging information options which it uses as defaults when it is started.&nbsp; The first thing
 to do is check to make sure that your application compiled with the default debugging information activated.
<dt><br>(22)
<dd><b> Choose Target Options</b> from the Targets menu to activate the Target Options menu.
<br>The option Use Development Switches should appear in grey text with a check mark next to it.&nbsp; Development Switches
 automatically include debugging information in the target.&nbsp; If you were to select Use Release Switches, the IDE would
 select options useful for a production version of your program.&nbsp; Selecting this option turns the text grey and places
 a check mark beside it.&nbsp; The IDE uses the development switches by default.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>For the purpose of this session, you should make the target with the development switches on.&nbsp; If this is not the option
 selected, select it and remake the target before debugging.

<h3 id="Review_of_What_Happened"> Review of What Happened </h3>
<br>In this session, you created a project called<tt> first.wpj.</tt>&nbsp; This project had one target called<tt> target1.exe,</tt>
 a 32-bit Windows executable (unless you specified another target type).&nbsp; Using the Open Watcom Editor, you entered and
 edited the source text in a file called<tt> source1.c</tt> or<tt> source1.for</tt> (if you tried the FORTRAN example).&nbsp;
 You compiled and linked it into an executable program using the Open Watcom Make utility, a Open Watcom compiler, and the
 Open Watcom Linker.&nbsp; You ran it directly and under the control of the Open Watcom Debugger.
<br><br>When you saved the project, the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment created the following permanent files:
<dl>
<dt>first.wpj
<dd>Describes the screen layout and refers to a file called<tt> target1.tgt</tt>
<dt><br>target1.tgt
<dd>Describes the target executable<tt> target1.exe</tt> and all switches required to link it.&nbsp; It also describes<tt> source1.c</tt>
 (or<tt> source1.for</tt>) and the switches required to compile it.
</dl>
<h2 id="The_Open_Watcom_IDE_Project_Window"> The Open Watcom IDE Project Window </h2>
<br>When you first start the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, an empty Open Watcom IDE Project window opens.
&nbsp; This window represents the project that is currently open in the IDE.&nbsp; The name of the current project appears
 in the title bar of this window.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is open a project for the Open Watcom IDE Project window.&nbsp; This can be a new project
 you create or an existing project you open.
<dl>
<dt>Important:
<dd>You can have only one project open at a time in the IDE.&nbsp; If you attempt to open or create a project while one already

<h3 id="Adding_a_Target"> Adding a Target </h3>
<br>You add targets to the current project using the New Target dialog.&nbsp; When you create a new project, this dialog appears
 automatically.&nbsp; You have two options when adding targets to a project:&nbsp; you can either enter the name of a new
 target or you can choose an existing target, previously created in another project.&nbsp; This section describes both methods
 for adding a target.
<dl>
<dt>To add a new target to the current project:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose New Target</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>The New Target dialog appears on the screen where you enter the details of the target you are adding.

<br><b><i>Figure 13.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Enter the new target details in the New Target dialog.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter the target name</b> in the Target Name field.
<br>Enter the entire pathname to ensure the directory is created where you want.&nbsp; Depending on the nature of the target,
 it may or may not be able to share the same directory as other pre-existing targets.&nbsp; Generally, if the target shares
 one or more of the same source files as other targets in the project, then it must be placed in its own subdirectory.&nbsp;
 The object files that are produced for the target may have different attributes than a pre-existing target's object files
 (e.g., 16-bit vs 32-bit).&nbsp; This is why the target should be placed in a separate subdirectory.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Select the desired Target Environment and Image Type</b> as desired.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> when the Target Name, Target Environment and Image Type fields are correct.
<br>If you specify a new directory in the target pathname, a message box appears asking if you want to create the specified
 directory.&nbsp; Choose Yes or No to continue.&nbsp; A window representing the new target appears on the Open Watcom IDE
 Project window.&nbsp; The target name appears in the title bar.
<br><br>The first line in this window describes the target.&nbsp; It specifies the current mode, the target type.&nbsp; The
 current mode is represented by either the letter D or R which appears in parentheses in front of the target type.&nbsp; The
 letter D indicates that the target is placed in Development mode.&nbsp; The letter R indicates that the target is placed
 in Release mode.&nbsp; The rest of the window displays the source files for the target.

</dl>
<h3 id="Minimizing_a_Target"> Minimizing a Target </h3>
<br>If you are working with a project that has multiple targets, the Open Watcom IDE Project window can become cluttered.
&nbsp; You can tidy your window by minimizing the target windows that you are not currently using.
<dl>
<dt>To minimize a target window:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click on the system box</b> in the upper left-hand corner of the target window you want to close.
<br>A menu appears listing the functions you can perform on the selected window.
<dt><br>(2)

<br><b><i>Figure 16.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Minimize targets to reduce clutter in the project window.</b>
<h3 id="Removing_a_Target"> Removing a Target </h3>
<br>The procedure for removing a target from a project is simple.&nbsp; If your project has multiple targets, it is important
 to ensure that the target you want to remove is the one selected.&nbsp; Removing a target does not permanently delete the
 target, it simply removes it from the current project.&nbsp; If the target is attached to multiple projects, those projects
 will not be affected by the removal of the selected target from the current project.
<dl>
<dt>To remove a target from the current project:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target window</b> you want to remove from the project.
<br>The title bar of the selected target window is highlighted.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Remove Target</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>A message box appears on the screen asking if you really want to remove the selected target.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose OK</b> to continue.
<br>The message box closes and the selected target window disappears from the Open Watcom IDE Project window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Renaming_a_Target"> Renaming a Target </h3>
<br>When renaming a target, you can either give it a new name or you can give it the name of an existing target.&nbsp; Choosing
 an existing target name overwrites the contents of the existing target with the contents of the current target.
<dl>
<dt>To rename a target:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target window</b> you want to rename.
<br>The title bar of the selected target window is highlighted.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Rename Target</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>The Rename Target dialog appears.&nbsp; The Target Name, Target Environment, and Image Type of the selected target appear
 in the appropriate fields.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide17.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 17.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Change a target's name using the Rename Target dialog.</b>

<dd><b> Click on the Browse button</b> and select an existing target name; click on OK when completed.
<br>The selected or entered target name appears in the Target Name field.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Verify that the Target Environment and Image Type are correct.</b>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> on the Rename Target window.
<br>The Rename Target dialog closes.&nbsp; The title bar of the selected target window now displays the new target name.
</dl>
<h3 id="Marking_a_Target_for_Remake"> Marking a Target for Remake </h3>
<br>Marking a target for remake ensures that the IDE will perform the link the next time you make that target or make all
 targets.&nbsp; This function is necessary if you are not using the Autodepend function in the Setup Target submenu under
 the Targets menu.&nbsp; By marking a target for remake, you control when and which targets need to be remade.
<dl>
<dt>To mark a target for remake:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target window</b> you want to mark.
<br>The title bar of the selected target window is highlighted.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Mark Target for Remake</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>A message box appears asking if you want to also mark all of the source files of the selected target.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Yes or No</b> to continue.
<br>Choosing Yes marks all of the source files for the selected target as well as the target itself.&nbsp; This means that
 the next time you do a make, the source files for the selected target will be compiled.&nbsp; Choosing No marks only the
 selected target for remake.&nbsp; In both cases, the message box closes and you return to the Open Watcom IDE Project window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Making_Targets"> Making Targets </h3>
<br>The Make function in the Targets menu creates an executable for the selected target.&nbsp; When you perform this function,
 the IDE compiles the source files for the selected target into object files.&nbsp; The object files are then linked together
 to create the target file.
<br><br>There are two make functions available to you for targets:&nbsp; Make and Make All.&nbsp; The Make All function in
 the Actions menu tells the IDE to compile and link all of the targets for the current project.&nbsp; This can be a lengthy
 process, depending upon the number of targets in your project, so you may choose to only make targets to which changes have
 been made.&nbsp; This enables you to see if they can be made successfully.
<br><br>Performing the Make function opens the IDE Log window which allows you to monitor the progress of the make.
<dl>
<dt>To make a single target:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target window</b> you want to make to select it.
<br>The title bar of the selected target window is highlighted.
<dt><br>(2)

 menus to display the submenus.
<h2 id="Working_with_Source_Files"> Working with Source Files </h2>
<br>Once your project has a target you need to add source files to the target.&nbsp; The procedure for adding a source file
 to a target is simple.&nbsp; Once you have source files that make up your target, you can also change the name of a source
 file and remove source files.&nbsp; This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Adding Source Files
<li>Removing Source Files
<li>Renaming a Source File
<li>Marking a Source File for Remake
<li>Making Source Files
<li>Viewing Included Files
</ul>
<h3 id="Adding_Source_Files"> Adding Source Files </h3>
<br>You add source files to the selected target (the target whose title bar is currently highlighted) using the Add File(s)
 dialog.&nbsp; The current project must have a target in order to use the New Source function.&nbsp; You have two options
 when adding source files to a target:&nbsp; you can either enter the name of a new source file or you can choose an existing
 source file.&nbsp; When adding existing source files you can use the file browser, type sources one at a time into the Add
 File(s) dialog, or use wild cards in the Add File(s) dialog.&nbsp; This section describes all methods for adding source files.
<br><br>The extension you use with the source file name determines the compiler that the IDE uses to create the target.&nbsp;
 For example, the &quot;.c&quot; extension, invokes the Open Watcom C compiler to make the target.&nbsp; You can specify several
 different compilers:
<dl>
<dt>xxx.asm
<dd>The &quot;.asm&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom Assembler.
<dt><br>xxx.c
<dd>The &quot;.c&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom C compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.cpp
<dd>The &quot;.cpp&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom C++ compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.for
<dd>The &quot;.for&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.hlp
<dd>The &quot;.hlp&quot; extension invokes either the Win16, OS/2, or Win32 compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.rc
<dd>The &quot;.rc&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom resource compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.res
<dd>The &quot;.res&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom Resource Editor.
<dt><br>xxx.sqc
<dd>The &quot;.sqc&quot; extension invokes the embedded SQL preprocessor and the Open Watcom C compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.sqp
<dd>The &quot;.sqp&quot; extension invokes the embedded SQL preprocessor and the Open Watcom C++ compiler.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>To add new source files to the selected target:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose New Source</b> from the Sources menu.
<br>The Add File(s) dialog appears where you specify the name(s) of the source file(s) you are adding.&nbsp; Source names
 must be filenames with extensions; pathnames are not required.
<br><br>For the OS/2 IDE, you can add multiple source files to the target at one time by inserting a space between each filename
 you enter into the filenames field.
<br><br>For all other systems, you can enter the names of the source files (with extensions) in the File Name field, one at
 a time.&nbsp; Once you have typed a name in the File Name field, you can add it to the list of source files to be included
 by clicking the Add button.&nbsp; Individual names can be removed from the &quot;add&quot; list by selecting them and clicking
 the Remove button.

<h3 id="Removing_a_Source_File"> Removing a Source File </h3>
<br>The procedure for removing a source file from a project is simple.&nbsp; You can remove one source at a time or you can
 remove all source files with a common file extension from the target.&nbsp; Removing a source file does not permanently delete
 the it.&nbsp; The IDE simply removes it from the current target.&nbsp; If the removed source file is common to multiple targets,
 the other targets will not be affected by the removal of the selected source file.
<dl>
<dt>To remove one source file from a target:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the source file</b> you want to remove from the target.
<br>The selected source file appears highlighted in the target window.

<h3 id="Marking_a_Source_File_for_Remake"> Marking a Source File for Remake </h3>
<br>The Mark Source for Remake function in the Sources menu enables you to mark a source file to ensure that the IDE will
 recompile it the next time you make the target.&nbsp; This function is useful because although changes may not have been
 made to the selected source file, changes may have been made to a source file on which the selected source file depends.
&nbsp; This function is necessary if you are not using the Autodepend function in the Target Options submenu under the Targets
 menu.&nbsp; Marking source files for remake gives you control over when and which source files need to be remade.
<br><br>With the Mark function you can mark an individual source file or a group of source files with a common file extension.

 included by that source file.&nbsp; This is a list of all files on which the selected source file depends.&nbsp; From this
 list you can select included files and edit them.
<br><br>Because the selected source file depends on the files in this list, it is necessary to remake it if changes are made
 to any of the included files.&nbsp; If you are using the Autodepend function, the IDE automatically remakes the source file
 if any of the included files are modified.
<dl>
<dt>To view the list of included files:
<dd>

<h3 id="Using_the_Autodepend_Switch"> Using the Autodepend Switch </h3>
<br>The Use Autodepend switch in the Target Options submenu of the Targets menu keeps track of updated source files.&nbsp;
 Once a source is modified, the IDE remembers that it needs to be recompiled the next time you do a make.&nbsp; By using the
 Use Autodepend switch, the IDE also keeps track of changes made to source files on which other source files depend.
<br><br>For example, let's say that your current project has a source file,<tt> source.cpp,</tt> that depends on a header
 file,<tt> source.hpp.</tt>&nbsp; If the Use Autodepend feature is not enabled and changes are made to<tt> source.hpp</tt>
 after<tt> source.cpp</tt> in your current project has been compiled, the IDE does not recognize that your current source
 file is now out of date.&nbsp; This means that the next time you do a make, the IDE will not compile<tt> source.cpp.</tt>
&nbsp; The Use Autodepend feature tells the IDE to compare the date and time stamps on all of the dependent source files in
 addition to the source files in the current project and their corresponding object files, so the IDE recognizes when your
 current source file needs to be recompiled.
<dl>
<dt>To set the Use Autodepend switch:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Target Options</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>A submenu appears from the Target Options menu.&nbsp; A check mark beside the menu option indicates that it is enabled.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select the Use Autodepend option</b> from the Target Options submenu.
<br>If the option was enabled when you selected it, you have disabled the Use Autodepend feature.&nbsp; If the option had
 no check mark when you selected it, you have enabled the Use Autodepend feature.

<br>A checkmark beside Auto Refresh indicates that auto refresh is enabled.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Auto Refresh.</b>
<br>The Auto Refresh state will be toggled.&nbsp; When Auto Refresh is disabled, it may be necessary to select Refresh from
 the Window menu whenever the target window status becomes out of date.
</dl>
<h3 id="Selecting_Your_Own_Text_Editor"> Selecting Your Own Text Editor </h3>
<br>You can use your own favourite text editor from within the Integrated Development Environment.
<dl>
<dt>To select your own text editor:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Text Editor</b> from the File menu.
<br>The Set Text Editor dialog appears.&nbsp; You can enter the name of the text editor in the first field.&nbsp; You must
 also indicate whether the text editor is an executable file or a Dynamic Link Library (DLL).&nbsp; If the editor is an executable
 file (rather than a DLL), then you can enter an argument line in the second field.&nbsp; The argument line will be supplied
 to the editor whenever it is started by the IDE.&nbsp; The argument line can include any of three different macros which
 will be filled in by the IDE.&nbsp; The macros are:
<dl>
<dt>%f
<dd>The name of the file to be edited.
<dt><br>%r
<dd>The row in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a line number then the row value is extracted from the message; otherwise the row value is 1.
<dt><br>%c
<dd>The column in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a column number then the column value is extracted from the message; otherwise the column value is 1.
</dl>
<br>For example, if the editor argument line that you specified was:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='%f' row='%r' col='%c'</tt>
<br><br>and you double click on an error message in the Log window that names the file<tt> foobar.c</tt> with an error at
 line 215 and column 31, then the argument line that is passed to your editor is:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='foobar.c' row='215' col='31'</tt>
<br><br>This flexibility allows you to specify the name of the file to edit and the row and/or column at which to position
 the text cursor.&nbsp; If no row or column is available, then the IDE will supply the value of 1 as a default.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select OK</b> when you wish to confirm the selection of a new editor.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select Cancel</b> when you wish to cancel the selection of a new editor.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select Default</b> when you wish to restore the default editor selection and then select OK or Cancel.
</dl>
<h3 id="Selecting_a_Source_Revision_Control_System"> Selecting a Source Revision Control System </h3>
<br>You can use a source code Revision Control System (RCS) in conjunction with the Integrated Development Environment.
<dl>
<dt>To select a revision control system
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Source Control</b> from the File menu.

<h2 id="Executing_Special_Commands"> Executing Special Commands </h2>
<br>Sometimes you may find it necessary to execute commands before and/or after performing a make.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Integrated
 Development Environment provides Before and After commands in the File and Targets menus.&nbsp; These commands enable you
 to perform actions immediately before or after making either the selected target or all targets for the current project.
<dl>
<dt>To set Before or After directives:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target</b> for which you want to set a before or after directive.
<br>The title bar of the selected target is highlighted.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Target Options</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>A submenu appears from the Target Options menu.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Execute Before or Execute After</b> from the Target Options submenu.
<br>A Target Before or Target After dialog appears on your screen.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If you want to set before or after directives to be executed when you make all targets, select the before and after commands
 from the File menu.
</dl>
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Enter the command</b> you want to execute before or after the selected target is made.
<br><tt><img src="ide29.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 29.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Enter execute commands in the Target Before or Target After dialogs.</b>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to continue.
<br>The IDE stores the information you entered and closes the dialog.&nbsp; When you next perform a make on the selected target,
 the IDE will execute the before or after directive you entered.
</dl>
<h2 id="Adding_Resources_to_a_Target"> Adding Resources to a Target </h2>
<br>You may want to include resources in your target executable.&nbsp; There are two ways of doing this in the IDE:&nbsp;
 indirectly and directly.&nbsp; The act of adding resources to a target can only be done for targets that support resources,
 such as Windows or OS/2 PM.
<dl>
<dt>To add a resource to a target using the indirect method:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Create a new source file</b> with the extension &quot;.rc&quot;.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Edit Text</b> from the Sources menu to invoke the Open Watcom Editor.
<br>The editor opens on your screen with an empty window.&nbsp; You can now add the resource file text.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Enter the resource statements</b> in the editor.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Save your work and close the editor</b> when you are finished.
<br>You return to the Open Watcom IDE Project window.&nbsp; You can now compile the new source file.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<br>The selected source file is highlighted in the target window.
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Choose Make</b> from the Sources menu to compile the new source file.
<br>The IDE compiles the selected source file.&nbsp; To do this, the IDE invokes the Resource Compiler which creates a &quot;.res&quot;
 file.&nbsp; The &quot;.res&quot; file will be automatically included in the target when it is linked.
</dl>
<br>When you create the resource file directly, the source file contains the same information but it is stored in a different
 format.
<dl>
<dt>To add a resource to a target using the direct method:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Create a new source file</b> with the extension &quot;.res&quot;.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Edit Resources</b> from the Sources menu to invoke the Open Watcom Resource Editor.
<br>The editor opens on your screen with an empty window.&nbsp; You can now create the resources.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Create the resources.</b>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Save your work and close the editor</b> when you are finished.
<br>You return to the Open Watcom IDE Project window.&nbsp; You can now compile the new source file.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<br>The selected source file is highlighted in the target window.
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Choose Make</b> from the Sources menu to compile the new source file.
<br>The IDE compiles the selected source file.&nbsp; The IDE does not need to invoke the Resource Compiler to create a &quot;.res&quot;
 file because you created the &quot;.res&quot; file directly using the Resource Editor.&nbsp; The &quot;.res&quot; file will
 be automatically included in the target when it is linked.
</dl>
<h2 id="Including_Libraries_in_a_Target"> Including Libraries in a Target </h2>
<br>You use the same procedure to include static and DLL libraries in your target as you use to add any source file to a target.
&nbsp; The IDE includes the libraries when the target is linked.
<dl>
<dt>To create static and DLL libraries:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Create a new target</b> entering the library name in the Target Name field and choosing the appropriate image type.
<br>Clicking on OK on the New Target dialog closes the dialog and creates a new target with the specified name in the title
 bar.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Add the desired source files,</b> new or existing, to the library you have created.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If you want one of your other targets to use that library, you must enter the library as a source file for that target.&nbsp;
 When you enter the library as a source file you must give it the extension &quot;.lib&quot;, regardless of whether the library
 is a static or DLL library.&nbsp; For example, if your library is entitled Target A and you want your existing Target B to
 use that library, add Target A as a source file on Target B with the extension &quot;.lib&quot;.
</dl>
</dl>
<h2 id="Targets_and_Image_Types_Supported_by_the_IDE"> Targets and Image Types Supported by the IDE </h2>

<h2 id="Invoking_Other_Applications_from_the_IDE"> Invoking Other Applications from the IDE </h2>
<br>When using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, there are several other applications you may want to use.
&nbsp; To save you the frustration of having to constantly exit the IDE and start up a new application, we have made it possible
 to invoke other applications from within the Integrated Development Environment.&nbsp; Following are the applications you
 can invoke from the IDE:
<ul>
<li>Browser
<li>Open Watcom Debugger
<li>Open Watcom Execution Sampler
<li>Open Watcom Execution Profiler
<li>Open Watcom Disassembler
<li>Open Watcom Editor (text editor)
<li>Open Watcom Resource Editor
<li>Open Watcom Zoom
<li>Open Watcom Heap Walker
<li>Spy
<li>DDE Spy
</ul>
<br>You invoke these applications by making a selection from the toolbar or various menus in the IDE.&nbsp; The Actions menu
 contains some of the applications.&nbsp; You can find others in the Targets and Sources menus.&nbsp; The menu options that
 appear vary, depending on the contents of the current project.&nbsp; The applications are available in the menu items only
 when appropriate.&nbsp; For example, if the currently selected target has no source files, no applications appear in the
 Sources menu.
<br><br><b><i>Hint:</i></b>&nbsp; An alternate way to view the contents of the Targets and Sources menu is to click the right
 mouse button while your cursor is positioned in the project window.&nbsp; If your cursor is positioned over a target, the
 Targets menu appears.&nbsp; If your cursor is positioned over a source file, the Sources menu appears.
<br><br>Refer to the appropriate sections in this manual for detailed information on using the various applications.
<h2 id="Invoking_DOS_Applications_from_the_IDE_under_OSD2"> Invoking DOS Applications from the IDE under OS/2 </h2>
<br>There are occasions where you may wish to change the default DOS or WIN-OS/2 settings when running a DOS/Windows application
 from the IDE.&nbsp; The mechanism which we provide is through the use of a special<b> IDE_DOS_SETTINGS</b> environment variable.
&nbsp; For example, to set the DPMI memory limit to 16 and to enable DOS BREAK, you can set the environment variable as follows:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set ide_dos_settings=dpmi_memory_limit#16;dos_break#1</tt>
<br><br>Due to the command processor limitations, the &quot;#&quot; character is used in place of the &quot;=&quot;.&nbsp;
 The above command is equivalent to configuring a DOS session with DOS settings as follows:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Variable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT&nbsp;&nbsp; 16</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DOS_BREAK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ON</tt>

&nbsp; See IDE2MAKE in Open Watcom Tools User's Guide.
<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Browser"> The Open Watcom Browser </h1>
<br><br>Imagine being assigned to a project with thousands of lines of C++ source code.&nbsp; Learning the relationship between
 the objects of such an application can be very difficult.&nbsp; The Browser was developed to solve this very problem - to
 help developers better understand the source code they are working with.&nbsp; Information such as the class inheritance
 hierarchy and the call tree for an application can be studied while using the Browser.&nbsp; Once you have located a symbol,
 you can quickly view the source file that contains its definition or list all the files that reference it.&nbsp; Viewing
 these relationships helps you understand how the program works.
<br><br>This chapter describes the many tasks you can perform with the Browser, including creating and opening a Browser database
 file, configuring the Browser session, and viewing the list of all symbols in your program, the class inheritance hierarchy,
 and call structure.
<h2 id="Using_the_Browser"> Using the Browser </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Starting the Browser
<li>Starting the Browser through the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment
<li>Quitting the Browser
<li>The Browser Menu Bar
</ul>
<h3 id="Starting_the_Browser"> Starting the Browser </h3>
<br>To start the Browser, double click on the Browser icon.&nbsp; This opens the Browser window.&nbsp; The caption bar of
 this window displays the current option file and Browser database file.&nbsp; The message<tt> no browser file</tt> appears
 on this line if a database file is not currently selected.
<br><br>The Browser is an integrated tool that you can open from the IDE so that you can browse the source code of the project
 you are working on.&nbsp; Refer to the IDE guide for further information on the Integrated Development Environment.
<h3 id="Quitting_the_Browser"> Quitting the Browser </h3>
<br>To exit the Browser, choose<b> Exit</b> from the<b> File</b> menu of the Browser window.&nbsp; If you made changes to
 the options during the Browser session, a message box appears prompting you to save the changes.
<br><br>Choose<b> No</b> in the message box to close the Browser session without saving.&nbsp; Any options changed within
 the session are lost.
<br><br>Choose<b> Yes</b> in the message box to save the current options to the current option file, if one exists, and exit
 the Browser session.&nbsp; If no option file exists, a<b> Save As</b> dialog appears that allows you to specify the option
 file to which you want to save the new options.
<dl>
<dt>
<dd><b> Select</b><b> Cancel</b> to return to the main Browser window without saving the options.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select</b><b> OK</b> to close the dialog and exit the Browser session.
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Browser_Menu_Bar"> The Browser Menu Bar </h3>
<br>The Browser's menu bar consists of the following eight menus:
<dl>
<dt>File
<dd>Create, open, and configure Browser files; save and load options
<dt><br>View
<dd>Choose a global view for the current database file
<dt><br>Detail

</dl>
<h2 id="Browser_Files"> Browser Files </h2>
<br>To browse your source code, you must first create a Browser module file for each source file that you wish to browse.
&nbsp; Currently, browsing is supported by the Open Watcom C/C++ compilers only (Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 does not support browsing).
&nbsp; To create a Browser module file, specify the &quot;db&quot; option when you compile the source file.&nbsp; If you are
 using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, select<b> Emit Browser Information</b> from the<b> Debugging Switches</b>
 panel of the<b> Compiler Switches</b> dialog.&nbsp; The Browser module file will have the same name as the source file and
 an extension of &quot;.MBR&quot;.
<br><br>Once the Browser module files have been created, these files are merged and a Browser database file is created.&nbsp;
 This process eliminates redundant information such as duplicate definitions that occur when a header file is included by
 many source files.&nbsp; Browser database files have the extension &quot;.DBR&quot;.
<br><br>The Browser allows you to configure your session and saves this configuration to an options file.&nbsp; Options files
 have the extension &quot;.OBR&quot;.&nbsp; The file name<tt> setup.obr</tt> is the default name of the options file.&nbsp;
 The default options file is automatically loaded by the Browser when the Browser is started.

</dl>
<h3 id="Creating_a_Browser_Database_File_from_the_Command_Line"> Creating a Browser Database File from the Command Line </h3>
<br>It is also possible to create the Browser database file from the command line.&nbsp; This allows you to make Browser database
 file creation part of your standard build procedure.&nbsp; When you do this, the batch build procedure will automatically
 update your database file.&nbsp; Updating the Browser database file occurs only if changes have been made to a module file
 within the database file.
<br><br>A separate utility, called the merger, is used to create the database file.&nbsp; The name of the merger program is<tt>
 wbrg.exe.</tt>&nbsp; Its command line consists of the name of the database file and a list of the module files (.MBR files)
 to be merged.&nbsp; The name of the database file must be preceded by a<tt> database</tt> command.&nbsp; The default extension
 given to the database file is &quot;.DBR&quot;.&nbsp; The list of module files must be preceded by a<tt> file</tt> command.
&nbsp; The module file names must be separated by commas or enclosed by curly braces and separated by spaces.&nbsp; The list
 of module file names can contain wild cards.&nbsp; The following are examples of valid merger commands.&nbsp; In each case,
 the module files<tt> m1.mbr</tt> and<tt> m2.mbr</tt> will be processed and the database file<tt> db.dbr</tt> will be created.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg database db file m1, m2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg database db file { m1 m2 }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg file m1, m2 database db</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg file { m1 m2 } database db</tt>
<br><br>It is also possible to specify a command file that contains merger commands.&nbsp; Command files have the extension
 &quot;.CBR&quot;.&nbsp; Consider a command file, called<tt> merge.cbr,</tt> containing the following merger commands.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database db</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file m1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file m2</tt>
<br><br>The following example will achieve the same results as the previous example.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wbrg @merge</tt>
<br><br>If you want to suppress the listing of file names that the merger produces as it is working, you can include the &quot;quiet&quot;
 option on the command line or in the command file.

<h3 id="Working_with_Browser_Module_Files"> Working with Browser Module Files </h3>
<br>Once a Browser database file is loaded, you might want to edit the list of modules originally used to create the database
 file.&nbsp; Editing the list of modules allows you to temporarily remove modules from the database or add modules to the
 database.&nbsp; For example, you may decide that you only want to browse a particular module or set of modules or you may
 have forgotten a module when the database was originally created.
<br><br>The<b> Modules</b> menu item in the<b> File</b> menu allows you to view the list of module files that make up the
 current database file.&nbsp; From this list you can perform the following functions on the module files:

<h2 id="Global_Views"> Global Views </h2>
<br>The menu items under the View menu let you display a global view of your program.&nbsp; A global view is one that displays
 relationships between all symbols in your program.&nbsp; The following are global views.
<dl>
<dt>List
<dd>Displays a list of all symbols in your program
<dt><br>Inheritance
<dd>Displays the class inheritance graph for your program
<dt><br>Call
<dd>Displays the call graph for your program
</dl>
<br>Once a global view has been displayed, you can view detailed information for the symbols in the global view.&nbsp; Refer
 to the section entitled <a href="#Viewing_Detail_Information">Viewing Detail Information</a> for a discussion on displaying
 detail information.
<br><br>It is possible to specify a query that restricts the symbols displayed in global views.&nbsp; See the section entitled
 <a href="#Global_Symbol_Queries">Global Symbol Queries</a> for more information.
<h3 id="The_List_View"> The List View </h3>
<br>Using the Browser to view the symbols in your program is much faster than searching through your source code for symbol
 information.&nbsp; From the symbols list you can quickly access detailed information on a symbol that tells you where the
 symbol is used and where it is defined.
<br><br>To view a list of all symbols in the current Browser database file, choose<b> List</b> from the<b> View</b> menu.
&nbsp; This displays a window which can list all symbols in your program.&nbsp; The window has a vertical scroll bar that
 allows you to scroll through the list of symbols in your program.&nbsp; Since your program may contain a very large number
 of symbols, the Browser does not load all the symbols in your program from the database.&nbsp; Instead, only the number of
 symbols that can be displayed in the window are loaded.&nbsp; As far as the Browser is concerned, this list is infinite.
&nbsp; For this reason, the scroll thumb on the vertical scroll bar is positioned in the middle of the vertical scroll bar
 and cannot be moved.&nbsp; Click below the vertical scroll thumb to view the next page of symbols and above the vertical
 scroll thumb to view the previous page of symbols.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow4.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 33.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The List window displays all symbols in the current browser database file.</b>
<br><br>Each symbol has a icon to its left.&nbsp; A letter marking each icon indicates the symbol type in the source code
 as follows:
<dl>
<dt>F
<dd>Function
<dt><br>C
<dd>Class
<dt><br>T
<dd>Typedef
<dt><br>V
<dd>Variable
<dt><br>E
<dd>Enum
</dl>
<br>There are several ways to display the detail view of symbols.&nbsp; When you reveal the detail view, the file folder icon
 changes to an open file folder.&nbsp; To close the detail view dialog, click on the file folder.&nbsp; This changes the icon
 back to a closed folder and closes the dialog.&nbsp; To reveal the detail view of a symbol you can perform any of the following
 actions:
<ul>
<li>The file folder icons are hot spots that display the detail view of the selected symbol.&nbsp; To activate the hot spot,
 click once on the symbol name to select it and press ENTER to reveal the detail view.
<li>Click once on the file folder to reveal the detail view for that symbol.
<li>Click once on the symbol name to select it and choose<b> Detail</b> from the<b> Detail</b> menu.
<li>Double click on the symbol name.
</ul>
<h3 id="The_Class_Inheritance_View"> The Class Inheritance View </h3>
<br>Selecting<b> Inheritance</b> from the<b> View</b> menu displays the inheritance hierarchy of all of the C++ classes in
 your program using a tree.&nbsp; This allows you to see the relationships between base classes and derived classes.&nbsp;
 In the inheritance hierarchy, each node represents a class.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 34.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Inheritance view displays the hierarchy of all C++ classes in your program

<dt>Graph view
<dd>The graph view displays each class in a box.&nbsp; A box, or node, is connected to another node if one is a derived class
 of the other.&nbsp; The root node of the tree is the base class for all nodes in the tree.&nbsp; The tree is initially fully
 expanded.&nbsp; See the section entitled <a href="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</a> for more
 information on removing and expanding nodes from the tree.
<dt><br>Outline view
<dd>The outline view displays the same information as the graph view but in a different way.&nbsp; The outline view is initially
 fully collapsed.&nbsp; That is, only the base classes are displayed.&nbsp; In order to view the derived classes of a node,
 you must single click on the node.&nbsp; This expands the node, displaying all its immediate derived classes.&nbsp; See the
 section entitled <a href="#Manipulating_the_Tree_Views">Manipulating the Tree Views</a> for more information on removing

<h3 id="The_Function_Call_Tree_View"> The Function Call Tree View </h3>
<br>Selecting<b> Call</b> from the<b> View</b> menu displays the function call tree for all functions in your program.&nbsp;
 This allows you to see all the functions that a given function calls and conversely all functions that call a certain function.
&nbsp; In the call tree, each node represents a function.

<br>You expand and collapse nodes in the graph and outline views to hide and reveal descendant and ancestor nodes of the selected
 node.&nbsp; There are two ways to expand and collapse nodes:
<ul>
<li>choose the desired function from the<b> Tree</b> menu
<li>click on the node (applies only to the outline view)
</ul>
<br>In addition to these functions, you can force the graph to be redrawn when a node in the tree view is collapsed.&nbsp;
 By default, collapsed nodes will leave a gap in the graph.&nbsp; Redrawing the graph removes these gaps.&nbsp; This feature
 is controlled by an option.&nbsp; See the section entitled <a href="#Configuring_the_Browser">Configuring the Browser</a>
 for more information.
<br><br>Clicking on the right mouse button when the mouse cursor is in a tree view will automatically display the<b> Tree</b>
 menu.&nbsp; This allows you to perform the actions in the<b> Tree</b> menu without actually going to the menu bar.
<h4 id="Selecting_Root_Nodes"> Selecting Root Nodes </h4>
<br>Select<b> Select Root Nodes</b> from the<b> Tree</b> menu to change the root nodes that are displayed.&nbsp; The root
 nodes you select appear in the graph or outline view; all other root nodes are hidden.
<br><br>Choosing<b> Select Root Nodes</b> from the<b> Tree</b> menu opens the<b> Select Root Nodes</b> dialog.&nbsp; This
 dialog lists all of the symbols that appear as a root node.&nbsp; Each symbol in the<b> Select Root Nodes</b> dialog has

<br>From a detail view,<b> Goto Definition</b> in the<b> Detail</b> menu allows you to edit the file that contains the symbol's
 definition.&nbsp; The editor is positioned on the line and column containing the symbols definition.&nbsp; This allows you
 to make edits to your source code while you are browsing.&nbsp; When you are done, save any changes made and exit the editor
 to return to the Browser session.
<br><br>Note that any changes to your source code will make the Browser database out-of-date.
<h3 id="Source_References"> Source References </h3>
<br>Selecting<b> Source References</b> from the<b> Detail</b> menu displays all locations in the source code where a symbol
 is referenced.&nbsp; This allows you to analyze all uses of a particular symbol.
<br><br>When modifying a symbol, you can use this feature to locate all occurrences of the symbol in the source code so you
 can update them.
<dl>

<br><b><i>Figure 40.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Use the Find dialog to locate one symbol or a set of symbols.</b>
<h4 id="Find_Pattern"> Find Pattern </h4>
<br>In the<b> Pattern</b> field of the<b> Find</b> dialog, enter a pattern for the symbol(s) you wish to locate.&nbsp; The
 matching behaviour depends on the switches set in this dialog.
<dl>
<dt>Match Case
<dd>When enabled, the Browser performs a case sensitive compare when attempting to find a match.
<dt><br>Match Whole Symbols Only
<dd>When enabled, the Browser locates symbols that exactly match the specified pattern.&nbsp; This switch only applies when the<b>
 Use Regular Expressions</b> switch is disabled.
<dt><br>Use Regular Expressions
<dd>When enabled, the Browser interprets the pattern specified as a regular expression.&nbsp; The<b> Edit</b> button, when pressed,
 displays the<b> Regular Expression Options</b> dialog.&nbsp; This dialog allows you to specify the regular expression.
</dl>
<br>Dropping the combo box of the<b> Pattern</b> field displays a list of previous patterns entered.&nbsp; You can select
 a pattern from this list instead of entering a new one.
<h4 id="Find_Filters"> Find Filters </h4>
<br>Clicking on the<b> Filters</b> button on the<b> Find</b> dialog opens the<b> Find Filters</b> dialog.&nbsp; This dialog
 allows you to specify the characteristics of the symbol(s) to be located.

</dl>
<br></tt><b>Find File Filters</b></tt>
<br>The<b> Source Files</b> button, when pressed, displays the<b> Source Files</b> dialog that allows you to specify the files
 to be searched when attempting to locate a symbol.&nbsp; This dialog lists all source files that make up the database file.
&nbsp; Each source file in the list has a check box.&nbsp; An X in this box indicates that the source file is searched when
 trying to locate a symbol.&nbsp; Click in the check box of the source file you want to disable.&nbsp; This removes the X.
&nbsp; The blank box indicates that the source file will not be searched when trying to locate a symbol.&nbsp; To re-enable
 the source file, click in the check box again.&nbsp; This places an X in the box indicating that the source file will be
 searched.
<br><br><tt><img src="brow13.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 42.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Choose the source files to be searched using the Source Files dialog.</b>
<br><br>The<b> Pattern</b> section of the dialog, allows you to specify wild card directory specifications for files that
 are to be included or excluded in the search.&nbsp; For example, specifying &quot;d:\watcom\h\*.h&quot; and pressing the<b>
 Exclude</b> button, will prevent any file in the &quot;d:\watcom\h&quot; directory with extension &quot;.h&quot; from being
 searched.&nbsp; To include these files in the search again, specify the same pattern and press the<b> Include</b> button.
<br><br>Pressing the<b> Set All</b> button includes all files in the search.
<br><br>Pressing the<b> Clear All</b> button excludes all files in the search.&nbsp; This is useful, for example, if you wish
 to only search files in the current directory.&nbsp; Simply press the<b> Clear All</b> button, specify &quot;*.*&quot; in
 the Pattern section, and press the<b> Include</b> button.
<h4 id="Performing_the_Find"> Performing the Find </h4>
<br>Once the filter criteria are set, perform the find operation by clicking on the<b> OK</b> button on the<b> Find</b> dialog.
&nbsp; This closes the dialog and performs the search.&nbsp; The Browser examines the symbols in the current global view and
 selects the first symbol that matches the search criteria.
<br><br>To find the next symbol that matches the search criteria, choose<b> Find Next</b> from the<b> Locate</b> menu.
<h3 id="Find_Selected"> Find Selected </h3>
<br>Because the symbols displayed in a global view are often many, only a portion of the display is visible in the window
 at any time.&nbsp; When you temporarily scroll away from the selected symbol or node, a quick method of locating that symbol
 is to select<b> Find Selected</b> from the<b> Locate</b> menu.&nbsp; This will immediately locate and display the currently
 selected symbol in the global view.

<h3 id="Selecting_a_Text_Editor"> Selecting a Text Editor </h3>
<br>You can use your own favourite text editor from within the Browser.
<dl>
<dt>To select your own text editor:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Text Editor</b> from the Options menu.
<br>The Set Text Editor dialog appears.&nbsp; You can enter the name of the text editor in the first field.&nbsp; You must
 also indicate whether the text editor is an executable file or a Dynamic Link Library (DLL).&nbsp; If the editor is an executable
 file (rather than a DLL), then you can enter an argument line in the second field.&nbsp; The argument line will be supplied
 to the editor whenever it is started by the Browser.&nbsp; The argument line can include any of three different macros which
 will be filled in by the Browser.&nbsp; The macros are:
<dl>
<dt>%f
<dd>The name of the file to be edited.
<dt><br>%r
<dd>The row in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a line number then the row value is extracted from the message; otherwise the row value is 1.
<dt><br>%c
<dd>The column in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a column number then the column value is extracted from the message; otherwise the column value is 1.
</dl>
<br>For example, if the editor argument line that you specified was:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='%f' row='%r' col='%c'</tt>
<br><br>and you double click on an error message in the Log window that names the file<tt> foobar.c</tt> with an error at
 line 215 and column 31, then the argument line that is passed to your editor is:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='foobar.c' row='215' col='31'</tt>
<br><br>This flexibility allows you to specify the name of the file to edit and the row and/or column at which to position
 the text cursor.&nbsp; If no row or column is available, then the Browser will supply the value of 1 as a default.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select OK</b> when you wish to confirm the selection of a new editor.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select Cancel</b> when you wish to cancel the selection of a new editor.

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Save Options
<dd>Selecting<b> Save Options</b> from the<b> File</b> menu saves the updated options information to the current options file.
&nbsp; To save options in this way, an options file must be specified in the caption bar.&nbsp; 
<dt><br>Save Options As
<dd><b> Save Options As</b> in the<b> File</b> menu opens the<b> Save Options As</b> dialog.&nbsp; Specify the filename of the

<br>When enabled and an option file exists, the Browser saves the changes without prompting when you close the session.
<br><br>When enabled and no option file exists, the Browser displays a message box prompting you to save the new options.
&nbsp; Choose<b> No</b> in this box to close the Browser session without saving.&nbsp; Choose<b> Yes</b> in this box to display
 a<b> Save As</b> dialog where you specify the option file to which you want to save the new options.
</dl>
<h2 id="Setting_Source_Search_Paths"> Setting Source Search Paths </h2>
<br>You can specify a command line option to the Browser that allows you to specify alternate source file search paths.&nbsp;
 This option is useful when a database file is created on a system different from the one that is used to browse the application
 source code.&nbsp; The syntax of the command line option is:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path path_spec1;path_spec2;...</tt>
<br><br>Since the database files record explicit paths to source files, it is likely that the path will no longer be valid
 once the software is moved to another system.
<br><br>When the Browser cannot locate the specified file using its explicit path, it will search the paths listed in the
 path option.
<h1 id="Profile_Analysis_Tools"> Profile Analysis Tools </h1>
<br>This section describes how to use the profile analysis tools to enhance the performance of your program.&nbsp; There are
 two profile analysis tools:
<ul>
<li>The Open Watcom Execution Sampler (the sampler)
<li>The Open Watcom Execution Profiler (the profiler)
</ul>
<br>You must use both of these tools to discover where your code is spending time as it executes.
<br><br>First, you must run the<b> Sampler</b>.&nbsp; The sampler starts your application and, at a predetermined interval,
 records the location where your program is executing.&nbsp; This information is saved in a &quot;sample file&quot;.&nbsp;
 It is a statistical sampling of your program's execution.&nbsp; It is not exact information, but it is accurate enough to
 be a very useful tool to enhance your program's performance.&nbsp; See <a href="#The_Open_Watcom_Execution_Sampler">The Open Watcom Execution Sampler</a>.
<br><br>Second, you run the<b> Profiler</b>.&nbsp; It reads the sample file and displays the sample information graphically.
&nbsp; You can use the profiler to examine the sample data and narrow in on the places where your program spends large amounts
 of time.&nbsp; See <a href="#The_Open_Watcom_Execution_Profiler">The Open Watcom Execution Profiler</a>.
<br><br>Once you have discovered heavily executed portions of your program, you might want to rewrite then using a faster
 algorithm or fine tune your implementation of the current algorithms.
<dl>
<dt>Note
<dd>You must compile and link the program with debugging information.&nbsp; Use at least the<b> d1</b> option when compiling and
 the<b> debug all</b> option when linking.
</dl>
<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Execution_Sampler"> The Open Watcom Execution Sampler </h1>
<br>To run the sampler from the Integrated Development Environment, click on the toolbar item that looks like a stopwatch.
<br><br>The sampler's command line syntax is shown below.

<dt>WSAMPLE
<dd>is one of several versions of the sampler.&nbsp; See the section entitled <a href="#Sampler_Operating_System_Considerations">Sampler Operating System Considerations</a>
 for a description of how to run the sampler under various environments.
<dt><br>options
<dd>is a list of valid sampler options, each preceded by a slash (&quot;/&quot;) or a dash (&quot;-&quot;).&nbsp; Options may
 be specified in any order.
<dt><br>program
<dd>is the name of the program to be sampled.
<dt><br>arguments
<dd>is the set of arguments passed to the program.&nbsp; The program behaves just as if it were executed directly from the command
 line.&nbsp; If you normally run your program using:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;program &#91;arguments&#93;</tt>
<br><br>then it may be sampled using the following command:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample program &#91;arguments&#93;</tt>
<br><br>By default, the output of WSAMPLE is a sample file with the same name as the executable but with an extension of .SMP.
&nbsp; In the above example, it would be called<tt> PROGRAM.SMP.</tt>
</dl>
<h2 id="Sampler_Options_Summary"> Sampler Options Summary </h2>
<br>The sampler has several command line options.&nbsp; A summary of the available options is displayed on the screen by executing
 the &quot;WSAMPLE&quot; program appropriate for your system.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usage: wsample &#91;options&#93; program &#91;program arguments&#93;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Options:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /b=&lt;size&gt; specify the buffer size for samples (default: 63)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /f=&lt;file&gt; specify the output filename for the sample file</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /r=&lt;rate&gt; specify the sampling rate</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;size&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a number in the range 1 to
 63 (default: 63 kb)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;rate&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a number (range 27 to 1000) specifying
 the approximate</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time
 interval (in milliseconds) between samples</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (default:
 55)</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '#' may be used instead of '=' in options (e.g., /b#10)</tt>
<h2 id="Sampler_Command_Line_Options"> Sampler Command Line Options </h2>
<br>Command line options allow you to control how much the program's execution will be affected by the presence of the sampler.
&nbsp; System specific options are described in detail in subsequent sections.&nbsp; The options that apply to all versions
 of the sampler are:
<dl>
<dt>/r=&lt;sample_rate&gt;
<dd>Specifies the approximate time between execution samples (in milliseconds).&nbsp; The sampler will set up the system so that
 the program will be interrupted in intervals of the number of milliseconds specified on the command line.&nbsp; A smaller
 number will result in a more accurate sample file.&nbsp; A larger number result in a less accurate sample.&nbsp; If your
 program runs for a very short time, you should use the smallest interval possible.&nbsp; The default value is system dependent
 and it will be displayed if you enter &quot;WSAMPLE&quot; with no arguments.&nbsp; The following example will sample the
 program's execution 200 times per second.
<br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample /r=5 program</tt>
<dt><br>/b=&lt;buffer_size&gt;
<dd>Specifies the size of the sampler's internal buffer (in kilobytes).&nbsp; The execution of the program will produce many samples
 which must be recorded in the sample file.&nbsp; The sampler stores the samples in an internal buffer until the buffer is
 filled and must be written to the disk.&nbsp; You may reduce the buffer size if you want to leave more memory for your application
 program.&nbsp; You should not make the buffer size so small that the sampler would have to write samples to disk more than
 once a second.&nbsp; The default size for the sample buffer is 63K.&nbsp; In the following example, a buffer size of 10K
 will be used:
<br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample /b=10 program</tt>
<dt><br>/f=&lt;fname&gt;
<dd>Specify the name of the sample file.&nbsp; Samples will be written to the specified file.&nbsp; By default, a file with the
 same name as the executable and an extension of .SMP is created.
</dl>
<h2 id="Sampler_Operating_System_Considerations"> Sampler Operating System Considerations </h2>
<br>There is a different version of the sampler to match each operating system.&nbsp; Some systems do not allow the sample
 rate to be adjusted.&nbsp; Each sampler will provide information about any unique aspects of its operation when you type
 its program name on the command line.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample</tt>
<br><br>Here are the Open Watcom Execution Sampler executable names provided.
<dl>
<dt><b><i>Operating System:</i></b>

</dl>
<br>The sampler for an operating system such as DOS will not operate correctly in an environment that is not strictly DOS
 such as a Windows or OS/2 DOS box.&nbsp; The sampler obtains its information about what was executing when a timer interrupt
 occurs from the stack.&nbsp; Unlike &quot;real&quot; DOS, the segment/offset on the stack in a protected-mode environment
 supporting Virtual DOS Machines does not correspond to the program that was executing at the time of the timer interrupt.
&nbsp; As a result, you must run the sampler in the real operating system environment for which it was designed.&nbsp; The
 same is true for Windows applications in a Win-OS/2 session.
<h3 id="Using_the_Sampler_with_DOS"> Using the Sampler with DOS </h3>
<br>The following options are available under DOS.&nbsp; For a further description of options, see <a href="#Sampler_Command_Line_Options">Sampler Command Line Options</a>.

<dt>/r=&lt;rate&gt;
<dd>Rates from 1ms to 55ms are allowed.
<dt><br>/b=&lt;size&gt;
<dd>Sizes from 1K to 64K are allowed.&nbsp; Since DOS places a limit on the amount of memory available to all programs, you may
 need to use the &quot;b&quot; option to reduce the memory requirements of the sampler, leaving more memory for your program.
<dt><br>/f=&lt;file&gt;
<dd>Specify the name of the sample file.
<dt><br>/i=&lt;interrupt&gt;
<dd>specify an interrupt to monitor
<br>This option allows you to assign any samples that occur while a service interrupt is executing to the instruction following
 the requesting INT instruction.&nbsp; This will reveal the amount of time code spends &quot;waiting&quot; for interrupt services.
&nbsp; The interrupt number specified is in base 16 (hex) and can be in the range 20 to ff except for the range 34 to 3d which
 is reserved for 80x87 emulation.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&gt;wsample /i=25 /i=26 program</tt>
<dt><br>/d
<dd>disable monitoring of the DOS interrupt
<br>By default, the DOS version of the sampler assigns any samples that occur while a DOS interrupt is executing to the instruction
 following the requesting INT 21H instruction.&nbsp; This will reveal the amount of time code spends &quot;waiting&quot; for
 DOS to complete a service.&nbsp; This option can be used to disable this assignment of samples so that the total time spent
 executing in DOS code may be determined.

<h2 id="ZoomMIn_and_Backout"> Zoom-In and Backout </h2>
<br>The profiler allows you to<b> zoom-in</b> to successively more detailed views of your program.&nbsp; You may also<b> back-out</b>
 of any detail view.&nbsp; The levels of detail available are:
<dl>
<dt>Sample
<dd>This is a sample file.&nbsp; The profiler can show you information from several sample files at once.
<dt><br>Image
<dd>A sample file may consist of several images.&nbsp; These are your main executable file and any Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL)
 or NetWare Loadable Modules (NLM) that your application called while executing.
<dt><br>Modules
<dd>An image may consist of several modules.&nbsp; Each module is a compilation unit.&nbsp; It consists of all the source code
 generated by one invocation of the compiler.
<dt><br>Files
<dd>A module may be made up of several files.&nbsp; Your application may contain code that is generated by included files.
<dt><br>Functions
<dd>A file may contain several functions.&nbsp; These are all of the global functions that are defined within that file.
<dt><br>Source Lines
<dd>A function is made up of one or more source lines.
<dt><br>Assembler instructions
<dd>Each source line generates zero or more lines of assembler instructions.&nbsp; It is possible to get clues about expensive
 operations from the number of samples found at each instruction.&nbsp; For example, the C statement &quot;i = j + k * l&quot;
 will generate a multiply instruction.&nbsp; If you inspected the assembler instructions, you might find that the multiply
 instruction took the majority of the time in question.
</dl>
<br>The process of moving from higher levels to lower levels, say, from &quot;modules&quot; to &quot;functions&quot;, is called<b>
 zooming in.</b>&nbsp; Moving from lower levels to higher levels (&quot;assembler instructions&quot; to &quot;source lines&quot;)
 is called<b> backing out.</b>&nbsp; As you zoom into your program the size of the region will get smaller but the amount
 of detail will increase.&nbsp; Likewise, backing out will restore previous levels to the larger regions and reduced detail.
&nbsp; You may zoom-in and back-out of detail views in order to explore your applications execution characteristics.
<h2 id="Samples"> Samples </h2>
<br>After you have run the sampler, you are left with a sample file.&nbsp; It contains a record of all locations where your
 program was interrupted by the sampler.&nbsp; A<b> sample</b> is a record of the instruction pointer within the program at
 the point in time that the interrupt occurred.&nbsp; Regions of the program that consume large amounts of execution time
 have a larger number of samples associated with them.
<h2 id="Absolute_and_Relative_Percentages"> Absolute and Relative Percentages </h2>
<br>The most important piece of data that the profiler provides is the percentage of time that a region of code contributes
 to total execution time.&nbsp; At the highest level (images), these percentages reflect each image's contribution to the
 total execution time.&nbsp; As you successively zoom into modules and functions, you may become interested in the relative
 percentages.
<br><br>The percentage of time that a region contributes to the total program execution time of the<b> program</b> is called
 an<b> absolute</b> percentage.&nbsp; The percentage of time that a piece of a region contributes to the total execution time<b>
 of your current detail level</b> is called a<b> relative</b> percentage.
<br><br>As you zoom in to the source and assembly views, the absolute percentages of execution time may get quite small.&nbsp;
 The relative percentages help you to get a feel for the proportion of time involved within the detail view, but don't get
 fooled into thinking that a routine contributes more than it actually does.&nbsp; Your decisions about which code to optimize
 should always be based on absolute percentages.

 of execution time for each line.&nbsp; The green and red portions, taken together, show the percentage of a line<b> relative</b>
 to the current detail view.&nbsp; For example, if a detail line represented 10% of the total execution time, then the red
 absolute bar would take 10% of the histogram area.&nbsp; If the entire digital view represented 20% of the execution time,
 then the single detail line would have a green and red bar which would take 50% of the histogram area (10% is half the total
 time of the entire detail view).

<h2 id="How_to_Use_the_Profiler_Effectively"> How to Use the Profiler Effectively </h2>
<br>The fundamental principle behind the profiler is:<b>&nbsp; devote your attention to the heavily executed regions of the
 program in order to extract the most performance out of a program.</b>&nbsp; This principle can be applied to the different
 levels of detail within a program.&nbsp; You should focus on the modules that contribute the most time to the execution of
 a program.&nbsp; Within a module, you should focus on the functions that contribute the most time to the module's total execution
 time.&nbsp; Regions of the program that exhibit heavy use during the execution of a program will benefit most from improvement.
<br><br>A simple example will illustrate how this is accomplished.&nbsp; Suppose we have a program that has three distinct
 regions.
<dl>
<dt><b><i>Region</i></b>
<dd><b><i>Percentage</i></b>
<dt><br>1
<dd>10%
<dt><br>2
<dd>70%
<dt><br>3
<dd>20%
</dl>
<br>The percentages represent the percentage of the total execution time that the region contributed.&nbsp; If the program
 took 100 seconds to execute, we could know that regions 1, 2, and 3 took 10, 70, and 20 seconds respectively.&nbsp; Now suppose
 we could rewrite region 1 so that it was twice as fast.&nbsp; What would be the impact on the total execution time of the
 program?&nbsp; It is difficult to predict precisely but, as a rule of thumb, we would expect that if we made region 1 twice
 as fast, it would only take 5% of the original execution time as opposed to the original 10% before optimization.&nbsp; So,
 if the original program took 100 seconds to execute, we would expect region 1's contribution of time to drop from 10 seconds
 to 5 seconds making the execution time of the new program now 95 seconds.&nbsp; Notice that the region of code was twice
 as fast as before but the total effect on the execution of the program was small.&nbsp; The impact of rewriting the code
 was reduced because the region did not contribute greatly to the execution time of the original program.
<br><br>To illustrate the point of using a profiler tool to increase performance, let us now look at the effect on the program
 execution speed if we were to recode region 2 so that it was twice as fast as before.&nbsp; Using the previous rule of thumb,
 we would expect region 2's contribution to the original execution time to drop from 70% to 35%.&nbsp; Now, if the original
 program took 100 seconds to execute, we would have reduced the total execution time to 65 seconds by focusing on region 2.
&nbsp; Comparing these results, we can see that the most benefit was derived from doubling the speed of region 2 as opposed
 to doubling the speed of region 1.&nbsp; The change in region 2 reduced the execution time by 35% while the change to region
 1 reduced the execution time by 5% for roughly the same amount of work.&nbsp; The large amount of work involved in speeding
 up code means that the most productive avenue is to focus on the heavily executed regions of the program.

<br>The items in this area are:
<ul>
<li>Left aligned
<li>Center aligned
<li>Right aligned
</ul>
<br>When any of these items are dragged to a window in the status bar, it affects the alignment of the item currently displayed
 in the window.&nbsp; For example, you can drag the &quot;Center aligned&quot; item (the middle one) into the status bar window
 displaying the current time and the current time will be centered in the window.
<h4 id="Status_Bar_Contents___Commands"> Status Bar Contents :&nbsp; Commands </h4>

<dt><br>Wrap at EOF
<dd>Turn this option on if you want the search to continue at the beginning of the file when it reaches the end of the file.&nbsp;
 It will then continue to the starting point of the search.
</dl>
<h4 id="General_Options___Word_Definitions"> General Options :&nbsp; Word Definitions </h4>
<br>Use the Word Definition options to define pairs or ranges that are considered valid parts of a word.&nbsp; The default
 for Ctrl-Left/Right is __09AZaz which defines the underscore character, all numbers, and all upper and lower case letters.
&nbsp; The default for mouse clicks is ::..\__09AZaz which defines the colon, period, backslash, and underscore characters
 as well as all numbers, and upper and lower case letters.
<h4 id="General_Options___FilenamesDPaths"> General Options :&nbsp; Filenames/Paths </h4>
<br>Use the Filenames/Paths option to define the default directory to which the Editor writes temporary files and the Editor's
 history file.
<br><br>The Temp Directory is set, by default, from the<b> TMPDIR</b> environment variable if it is defined.
<br><br>Autosave files are written to the Temp Directory.
<h4 id="General_Options___Miscellaneous"> General Options :&nbsp; Miscellaneous </h4>
<br>Use the miscellaneous options to set:
<dl>
<dt>Beep on error
<dd>Turn this option on if you want an audible beep to sound when the Editor encounters an error.
<dt><br>Same-file check on open
<dd>Use this option to have the Editor check that a file you are opening is not already open.&nbsp; You can open multiple copies
 of the same file, however, the Editor keeps only the last version of the file saved.&nbsp; To open multiple copies of the
 same file, you must specify different paths.
<dt><br>Close rotates forward
<dd>Turn this option on if you want the Editor to rotate forward through the open files when you close the current file.
</dl>
<h3 id="File_Specific_Options"> File Specific Options </h3>
<br>The File Specific Options dialog contains settings that control your file including tabs, tags, line numbers, and default
 file extensions.
<br><br><tt><img src="vi11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 68.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The File Specific Options Dialog</b>

</dl>
<h4 id="File_Specific_Options___Language"> File Specific Options :&nbsp; Language </h4>
<br>The Editor allows you to highlight different parts of the syntax for the language you are using.&nbsp; This allows you
 to easily find the parts of code you are looking for because they are different colors and/or fonts.&nbsp; The Editor highlights
 lexical elements for C, C++, Fortran, Java and JavaScript, and HTML code (among others).
<br><br>The Language section also allows you to turn on C Indent Assist.&nbsp; The Editor then uses common C formatting conventions
 such as smart indenting and outdenting with braces.

 at the end of the file.
<li>Save the Editor's screen position when you exit the file.
<li>Clear messages after the next key is pressed instead of having them remain until the next error message occurs.
</ul>
<h3 id="Saving_the_Configuration"> Saving the Configuration </h3>
<br>The Save Configuration menu item will save your current configuration regardless of the status of the &quot;Save configuration
 on exit&quot; setting.&nbsp; The configuration information is saved to a<tt> weditor.ini</tt> file either in the user's home
 directory (on multi-user systems) or in the Windows system directory.
<h1 id="Regular_Expressions"> Regular Expressions </h1>
<br>Regular expressions are a powerful method of matching strings in your text.&nbsp; Commands that use regular expressions
 are:
<ul>
<li>forward slash (/) command mode key (search forwards)
<li>question mark (?) command mode key (search backwards)
<li>forward slash (/) command line address (search forwards)
<li>question mark (?) command line address (search backwards)
<li>substitute command line command
<li>global command line command
<li>egrep command line command
<li>match command line command
</ul>
<br>Different characters in a regular expression match different things.&nbsp; A list of all special (or &quot;magical&quot;)
 characters is:&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>A backslash (\) followed by a single character other than new line matches that character
<li>The caret (^) matches the beginning of a line
<li>The dollar sign ($) matches the end of a line
<li>The dot (.) matches any character
<li>A single character that does not have any other special meaning matches that character
<li>A string enclosed in brackets &#91;&#93; matches any single character from the string.&nbsp; Ranges of ASCII character
 codes may be abbreviated as in a &quot;a-z0-9&quot;.&nbsp; A &#93; may occur only as the first character of the string.&nbsp;
 You must place a literal - where it cannot be mistaken as a range indicator.&nbsp; If a caret (^) occurs as the first character
 inside the brackets, then any characters NOT in the string are matched
<li>A regular expression followed by an asterisk (*) matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the regular expression
<li>A regular expression followed by a plus sign (+) matches one or more matches of the regular expression
<li>A regular expression followed by a question mark (?) matches zero or one matches of the regular expression
<li>Two regular expressions concatenated match a match of the first followed by a match of the second
<li>Two regular expressions separated by an or bar (|) match either a match for the first or a match for the second
<li>A regular expression enclosed in parentheses matches a match for the regular expression
<li>The order of precedence of operators at the same parenthesis level is the following:&nbsp; {}, then *+?, then concatenation,
 then /.
<li>All regular expressions following an at sign (@) are treated as case sensitive
<li>All regular expressions following a tilde (~) are to be treated as case insensitive
<li>If an exclamation point (!) occurs as the first character in a regular expression, it causes the ignoring of the<b><i>
 magic</i></b> setting; that is, all magic characters are treated as magical.&nbsp; An exclamation point (!) is treated as
 a regular character if it occurs anywhere but at the very start of the regular expression.
</ul>
<br>If a regular expression could match two different parts of the line, it will match the earliest one.&nbsp; If both begin
 in the same place, but match different lengths, or match the same length in different ways, then the rules are more complicated.
<br><br>In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are considered from left to right, the possibilities for *, +,
 and ?&nbsp; are considered longest first, nested constructs are considered from the outermost in, and concatenated constructs
 are considered leftmost first.&nbsp; The match that is chosen is the one that uses the earliest possibility in the first
 choice that has to be made.&nbsp; If there is more than one choice, the next will be made in the same manner (earliest possibility)
 subject to the decision on the first choice.&nbsp; An so forth.
<br><br>For example, (ab|a)b*c could batch the string<b> abc</b> in one of two ways.&nbsp; The first choice is between<b>
 ab</b> and<b> a.</b>&nbsp; Since ab is earlier in the expression and does lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen.
&nbsp; Since the<b> b</b> is already spoken for, the<b> b*</b> must match its last possibility since it must respect the earlier
 choice.
<br><br>If there are no |'s present and only one *m, +, or ?, the net effect is that the longest possible match will be chosen.
&nbsp; So<b> ab</b> presented with xabbbby, will match<b> abbbbb.</b>&nbsp; Note that is<b> ab*</b> is tried against<b> xabyabbbz,</b>
 it will match<b> ab</b> just after<b> x,</b> due to the begins earliest rule.
<h2 id="Regular_Expression_BNF"> Regular Expression BNF </h2>
<br>A pseudo-BNF for regular expressions is:
<dl>
<dt>reg-exp
<dd>{branch}|{branch}|...
<dt><br>branch
<dd>{piece}{piece}...
<dt><br>piece
<dd>{atom{* or + or ?}}{atom {* or + or ?}}...&nbsp; *-match 0 or more of the atom; +-match 1 or more of the atom; ?-match a match
 of the atom, or the null string.
<dt><br>atom
<dd>(reg-exp) or range or @ or ^ or $ or \char or char.
<dt><br>range
<dd>&#91;{^} char and/or charlo-charhi&#93;.&nbsp; ^ causes negation of range.
<dt><br>.
<dd>Match any character.
<dt><br>^
<dd>Match start of line.
<dt><br>$
<dd>Match end of line.
<dt><br>@
<dd>Search with case sensitivity.
<dt><br>~
<dd>Search without case sensitivity.
<dt><br>!
<dd>If it occurs as the first character in a regular expression, the magic setting is ignored; that is, all magic characters are
 treated as magical.&nbsp; !&nbsp; is treated as a regular character if it occurs anywhere but at the very start of the regular
 expression.
<dt><br>char
<dd>Any character.
<dt><br>\char
<dd>Forces \char to be accepted as char (no special meaning) except \t matches a tab character if<b><i> realtabs</i></b> is set.
</dl>
<h2 id="File_Matching_Regular_Expressions"> File Matching Regular Expressions </h2>
<br>When specifying a file name in the Editor, it is possible to use a file matching regular expression.&nbsp; This expression
 is similar to a regular expression, but has a couple of differences:
<ol>
<li>A dot (.) specifies an actual dot in the file name.
<li>An asterisk (*) is the same as .* (matches 0 or more characters).
<li>A question mark (?) is the same as a regular expression dot (.); that is, a question mark matches exactly one character.
<li>A caret (^) has no meaning.
<li>A dollar sign ($) has no meaning.
<li>The backslash (\) has no meaning.&nbsp; It is used to separate directories.
</ol>
<br>Suppose we have the following list of files:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.c</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc.c</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bcd.c</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bad</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xyz.c</tt>
<br><br>The following examples show how the files from the above list are matched by various file name regular expressions.
<dl>
<dt>a*.c
<dd>All files that start with<tt> a</tt> and end in<tt> .c.</tt>&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> a.c</tt> and<tt> abc.c</tt>
<dt><br>(a|b)*.c
<dd>All files that start with an a or a b and end in .c.&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> a.c, abc.c,</tt> and<tt> bcd.c</tt>
<dt><br>*d.c
<dd>All files that end in<tt> d.c.</tt>&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> bcd.c</tt>
<dt><br>*
<dd>All files.
<dt><br>*.*
<dd>All files that have a dot in them.&nbsp; Therefore, it matches<tt> a.c, abc.c, bcd.c, xyz.c</tt>
</dl>
<h2 id="Replacement_Strings"> Replacement Strings </h2>
<br>There are special characters to use in the replacement string if you use regular expressions in the search and replace
 function.
<dl>
<dt>&amp;
<dd>Replace each instance of &amp; in the replacement string with the entire string of matched characters
<dt><br>\\
<dd>Enter a \ in the replacement string
<dt><br>\n
<dd>Replace with a new line
<dt><br>\t
<dd>Replace with a tab (if<b><i> realtabs</i></b> is set)
<dt><br>\&lt;n&gt;
<dd>Replace each instance of &lt;<b> n</b> &gt;, where &lt;<b> n</b> &gt; is a digit from 0 to 9, with the n'th sub-expression
 in the regular expression
<dt><br>\u
<dd>Change the next item in the replacement string to upper case
<dt><br>\l
<dd>Change the next item in the replacement string to lower case
<dt><br>\U
<dd>Change all items following \U in the replacement string with upper case, until \e, or \E is encountered
<dt><br>\L
<dd>Change all items following \L in the replacement string with lower case, until \e, or \E is encountered
<dt><br>\e, \E
<dd>End the change to upper (\U) or lower case (\L)
<dt><br>\|&lt;n&gt;
<dd>Substitute spaces up to column &lt;n&gt;, so that the item that follows occurs at column &lt;n&gt;
<dt><br>\#
<dd>Substitute the current line number on which the match occurred.
</dl>
<h2 id="Controlling_Magic_Characters"> Controlling Magic Characters </h2>
<br>By default, all special characters in a regular expression are magical; that is, if a special character is used, it has
 a special meaning.&nbsp; To use a special character, like (, you must escape it (\().
<br><br>However, it is possible to change this using the<b><i> magic</i></b> setting in the General Options dialog.&nbsp;
 If<b><i> magic</i></b> is turned on, then all special characters are magical.&nbsp; If<b><i> magic</i></b> is turned off,
 then any special characters listed in<b> Magic String Edit Control</b> in the General Options dialog lose their special meaning
 and are treated as regular characters.&nbsp; If<b><i> magic</i></b> is turned off and you want to use the characters in their
 magical way, you must escape them with a \.
<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Resource_Editor"> The Open Watcom Resource Editor </h1>
<br><br>The Open Watcom Resource Editor is a full-featured editor that enables you to easily create and edit resources and
 the files that contain them.&nbsp; A file containing one or more resources will generally be referred to as a resource file.
&nbsp; A resource file may be an executable (.EXE), resource file (.RES), dynamic link library (.DLL), bitmap file (.BMP),
 cursor file (.CUR), or icon file (.ICO).&nbsp; The editor also supports a variety of resource scripts.&nbsp; They include
 dialog (.DLG), accelerator (.ACC), menu (.MNU), and string (.STR) scripts.&nbsp; This support is accomplished by maintaining
 a synchronized resource file (.RES) in the same directory as the resource script.&nbsp; Opening a resource file reveals a
 Resource window in the Resource Editor window.&nbsp; This window is a visual representation of the resource file.
<br><br>A resource is a piece of data with a specific format that Windows uses to create the visual and interactive elements
 of your application.&nbsp; Most of the visual aspects of Windows applications are the result of the application having resources,
 all of which can be created using the Open Watcom Resource Editor.&nbsp; Use the Resource Editor to create and edit the following
 resource types:

<br>When designing your application's user interface, the resources are separate from the application's source code.&nbsp;
 This makes changing the user interface a simple task.&nbsp; Instead of accessing the application's source code, you can make
 the changes directly to the resources.&nbsp; You can manipulate some aspects of the resources, such as the memory flags and
 resource names, without invoking the resource's associated editor.&nbsp; Invoking the desired editor from the Resource Editor
 enables you to change all aspects of the selected resource.
<br><br>Different applications often use the same or similar resources, such as bitmaps, icons, dialogs, and menus.&nbsp;
 The Resource Editor enables you to create resource files for a new application by reusing existing resources.&nbsp; Copying
 a resource from existing applications into the new resource file makes the task of creating your user interface quick and
 simple.

<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Accelerator_Editor"> The Open Watcom Accelerator Editor </h1>
<br>The Accelerator Editor enables you to create and edit accelerator items so you can invoke menu items without using a mouse.
&nbsp; Accelerators define hot keys for menu items in your application.&nbsp; These enhance the user interface for more advanced
 users of the application.
<br><br>Accelerators are keyboard equivalents for menu items, such as Ctrl+S or F2.&nbsp; For example, many applications associate
 the accelerator Ctrl+C with the Copy item in the Edit menu.<b><i>&nbsp; The Windows Interface:&nbsp; An Application Design
 Guide</i></b> suggests some standard accelerators.
<br><br>An accelerator item is made up of a key value, menu item identifier, and flags.&nbsp; These components define the
 key combination the user presses to access the specified menu item.&nbsp; The Accelerator Editor stores the accelerator items
 in an accelerator table.&nbsp; You can have multiple accelerator tables for a resource file.
<br><br>The accelerator editor allows you to create new accelerators and edit existing accelerators without having to create
 a resource script or use a resource compiler.&nbsp; Without the accelerator editor, you would have to use the resource compiler
 to add accelerators to your applications.
<h2 id="Using_the_Accelerator_Editor"> Using the Accelerator Editor </h2>

<h2 id="Using_the_Accelerator_Editor_Window"> Using the Accelerator Editor Window </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom Accelerator Editor window contains a menu bar, toolbar, and status line to help you create and edit accelerators.
&nbsp; The rest of the window, the workspace, is divided into four sections:
<ul>
<li>Resource Name Field
<li>Attributes Area
<li>Accelerator Item List
<li>Action Buttons
</ul>
<br><tt><img src="acc4.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 85.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Accelerator Editor window contains a menu bar, toolbar, status line, and
 workspace.</b>
<h3 id="Accelerator_Editor__Resource_Name_Field"> Accelerator Editor:&nbsp; Resource Name Field </h3>
<br>The Resource Name field in the Open Watcom Accelerator Editor window contains the name of the accelerator table currently
 being edited.&nbsp; A resource file can contain more than one accelerator table, so it is important that the resource names
 for the accelerator tables be unique.&nbsp; The Resource Name field is not case sensitive and can hold up to 255 characters.
&nbsp; You can enter a textual name, a number or a symbol in this field.
<br><br>When you create a new accelerator table, the Resource Editor assigns the default name ACCELERATOR_# to it, where #
 is a decimal number starting at one and increasing for each new resource of that type opened.&nbsp; You can rename the accelerator
 table using the Rename item in the Resource menu.
<h3 id="Accelerator_Editor__Attributes_Area"> Accelerator Editor:&nbsp; Attributes Area </h3>
<br>The attributes area provides information about the currently selected accelerator item.&nbsp; You can edit accelerator
 items using only the fields in this area.
<br><br><tt><img src="acc5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 86.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Accelerator Editor attributes area</b>
<br><br>Accelerator item attributes are displayed in four sections.&nbsp; Following is an explanation of each section.

<h2 id="Accelerator_Functions"> Accelerator Functions </h2>
<br>You can perform several functions with the Accelerator Editor.&nbsp; This section describes the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Adding a New Accelerator Item
<li>Changing an Existing Accelerator Item
<li>Deleting Accelerator Items
<li>Renaming an Accelerator Table
<li>Saving Accelerator Items
<li>Using Shortcuts to Create Accelerator Tables
<li>Changing Memory Options
</ul>
<h3 id="Adding_a_New_Accelerator_Item"> Adding a New Accelerator Item </h3>
<br>The steps for adding a new accelerator item to the accelerator table are the same, regardless of whether the accelerator
 table is empty or already contains accelerator items.
<dl>
<dt>To add a new accelerator item:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Position the cursor in the Key field.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter the desired key value</b> that will activate the menu item.
<br>You can enter a single key, such as a letter or number, or a key sequence.&nbsp; A key sequence may be made up of a modifier
 and a key, such as ^k for Ctrl+k.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Enter a symbol or numeric identifier</b> for the menu item that is activated by the entry in the Key field.
<br>The symbol or numeric identifier you enter here is the identifier associated with the menu item.&nbsp; This relationship
 is defined in the Menu Editor.&nbsp; If you do not know the desired menu item identifier, open the appropriate menu and look
 up the identifier.&nbsp; It is not possible for the Accelerator Editor to get this information for you.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Specify ASCII or Virtual Key</b> in the Key Type section of the window.
<dl>
<dt>ASCII Keys
<dd>When the Key Type specified is ASCII, keys you press appear as characters, such as<b> a, B, 2,</b> or<b> $.</b>&nbsp; In the
 Key field, the ASCII characters are surrounded by quotation marks.&nbsp; For example,<b> c</b> appears as<b> &quot;c&quot;</b>
 and<b> Ctrl+C</b> appears as<b> &quot;^C&quot;.</b>&nbsp; When using ASCII characters as accelerators, you may combine them
 with the Ctrl key to form key sequences, such as Ctrl+X or Ctrl+P.&nbsp; There is no symbol to represent the Shift key in
 ASCII.&nbsp; Applying the Shift key with an ASCII character results in an upper case character in the Key field.&nbsp; For
 example,<b> Shift+d</b> appears as<b> &quot;D&quot;.</b>
<dt><br>Virtual Keys
<dd>When the Key Type specified is Virtual Key, you enter the standard Windows identifier for the desired key.&nbsp; For example,
 the Windows identifier for the Home key is<b> VK_HOME.</b>&nbsp; The header file WINDOWS.H defines these identifiers.&nbsp;
 To avoid looking up these identifiers yourself, use the Key Value function explained in the section<b> Editing the Key Value.</b>
&nbsp; To specify whether the Alt, Ctrl, or Shift keys must be pressed with another key to form a key sequence, mark the appropriate
 check box in the Modifiers section of the attributes area.
</dl>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Select the desired modifiers</b> in the Modifiers section.
<br>Modifiers are flags indicating keys that you must press in addition to the specified key value to activate the menu item.
&nbsp; When the ASCII option is selected, the Control and Shift modifiers are not available.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Press the Insert action button</b>
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Choose Insert New Item</b> from the Accelerator menu.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select the Insert New Item button on the toolbar.</b>
<br>The Accelerator Editor adds the new accelerator item to the accelerator table.&nbsp; When accelerator items exist in the
 accelerator table, one item is always selected.&nbsp; Choosing the Insert New Item menu item or button positions the new
 accelerator item directly after the selected accelerator item in the list.
</dl>
<h3 id="Changing_an_Existing_Accelerator_Item"> Changing an Existing Accelerator Item </h3>
<br>You may want to change the key value or the menu item identifier associated with an accelerator item.
<dl>
<dt>To modify an existing accelerator item:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click the accelerator item you want to modify.</b>
<br>The selected accelerator item appears highlighted in the accelerator item list and the accelerator item details appear
 in the attributes area of the window.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter the new accelerator item details</b> in the attributes area.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Press the Change action button</b>
<br>These actions update the selected accelerator item with the modified accelerator item attributes.
</dl>
<h4 id="Editing_the_Key_Value"> Editing the Key Value </h4>
<br>When editing only the key value of an accelerator item, use the Key Value function.&nbsp; With this function, the Accelerator
 Editor looks up the correct virtual key value for the selected key and inserts it into the accelerator item list for you.
&nbsp; This is a quick way to make accelerator item changes, but it only applies to accelerator items whose key type is Virtual
 Key.
<dl>
<dt>To use the Key Value function:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose the accelerator table you want to work with</b> from the Resource window on the Open Watcom Resource Editor window.
<br>The Accelerator Editor window appears displaying all of the accelerator items for the selected accelerator table.
<dt><br>(2)

<h3 id="Saving_Accelerator_Items"> Saving Accelerator Items </h3>
<br>There are two functions you can use to save accelerator tables with the Accelerator Editor:
<ul>
<li>Update 
<li>Save As
<li>Copy To
</ul>
<br>Each of these options performs a different type of save function.&nbsp; This section describes how to use each function.
<h4 id="Accelerator_Editor__Update"> Accelerator Editor:&nbsp; Update </h4>
<br>After modifying an accelerator item in an accelerator table, choose Update from the File menu on the Accelerator Editor
 window to save the updated accelerator table to the current resource file.&nbsp; This prevents the changes from being lost
 when you exit the Accelerator Editor.
<br><br>The Update function updates the resource file only at the resource level.&nbsp; The resource file is not saved until
 you perform a save at the Resource Editor level as well.&nbsp; Exiting the Resource Editor without saving causes you to lose
 the accelerator table changes made.
<h4 id="Accelerator_Editor__Save_As"> Accelerator Editor:&nbsp; Save As </h4>
<br>Choose Save As from the File menu on the Accelerator Editor window to save the current accelerator table to another resource
 file.
<br><br>If you added any new symbol names (Item ID's), a Save Symbol Header File dialog appears which allows you to create
 a new header file which includes the newly added symbol names.
<br><br><tt><img src="acc10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 91.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Save Symbol Header File dialog, specify the header file to which you
 want to save symbol ID's.</b>
<br><br>Afterwards, a Save Accelerator Table dialog appears where you specify the resource file to which you want to save
 the current accelerator table.
<br><br><tt><img src="acc11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 92.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Save Accelerator Table dialog, specify the resource file to which you
 want to save the accelerator table.</b>
<dl>
<dt>Important:
<dd>If the resource file to which you are saving the accelerator table already contains resources, the existing resources will
 be discarded and replaced with the accelerator table you are saving.
</dl>
<h4 id="Accelerator_Editor__Copy_To"> Accelerator Editor:&nbsp; Copy To </h4>
<br>Choose Copy To from the Resource menu of the Accelerator Editor window to copy the current accelerator table into an existing
 resource file.
<br><br>If you added any new symbol names (Item ID's), a Save Symbol Header File dialog appears which allows you to create
 a new header file which includes the newly added symbol names.
<br><br><tt><img src="acc10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 93.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Save Symbol Header File dialog, specify the header file to which you
 want to save symbol ID's.</b>
<br><br>Afterwards, a Copy To dialog appears where you specify the resource file to which you want to copy the current accelerator
 table.&nbsp; Unlike the Save As function, copying an accelerator table to a resource file adds an entry to the list of resources
 rather than replacing the existing resources with the new entry.
<br><br><tt><img src="acc12.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 94.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Copy To dialog, specify the resource file to which you want to copy the

<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Dialog_Editor"> The Open Watcom Dialog Editor </h1>
<br>Dialogs are windows that contain controls such as push buttons, check boxes, list boxes, and combo boxes.&nbsp; Dialogs
 are the principle medium for the exchanging of information between the user and the application.&nbsp; You include dialogs
 in your application to prompt the user for information, enable the user to change settings, and allow the user to make choices.
&nbsp; Dialogs provide the medium through which users and your application can communicate with each other.
<br><br>The Open Watcom Dialog Editor enables you to create dialogs.&nbsp; With this editor you can design and test your dialogs
 so you can see exactly how they will look and work in your application.
<br><br>The Dialog Editor allows you to create a new dialog or modify an existing dialog.&nbsp; When you complete the dialog
 you can save it as a resource script or binary resource file.&nbsp; You can also save your dialog directly to an .EXE or
 .DLL file if you originally loaded that dialog from one of these files.

<h2 id="Using_the_Dialog_Editor_Window"> Using the Dialog Editor Window </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom Dialog Editor window contains a menu bar, toolbar, toolbox, and status line.&nbsp; The rest of the window
 is divided into three sections:
<ul>
<li>The Information Bar
<li>The Edit Window
<li>The Workspace
</ul>
<br><tt><img src="dia6.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 101.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Dialog Editor window contains a menu bar, toolbar, workspace, and status

<h3 id="The_Dialog_Editor_Information_Bar"> The Dialog Editor Information Bar </h3>
<br>The Information Bar is located under the toolbar.&nbsp; It provides information about the currently selected object you
 are adding to the dialog or modifying.&nbsp; This object can be a control or the dialog window itself.&nbsp; There are three
 fields in the Information Bar.&nbsp; The contents of two fields depends on whether the selected object is a dialog or a control.
&nbsp; You may press F9 to set the keyboard focus to the Information Bar.&nbsp; While the Information Bar has the keyboard
 focus you may press ESCAPE to have the focus return to the Editor.
<br><br><tt><img src="dia7.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 102.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Dialog Editor information bar</b>
<br><br>Changes made to these fields are only processed once you press ENTER or click on the Set button.&nbsp; Reverse uncommitted
 changes by clicking on the Discard button.
<dl>
<dt>Size
<dd>The Size field in this area contains three sets of numbers.&nbsp; These numbers provide information on the size and position
 of the selected dialog or object in the Edit Window.&nbsp; The default number sequence when you create a new dialog is:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (20, 20) (115, 95) 95x75</tt>
<br><br>(20, 20) indicates that the top left hand corner of the dialog is at the position 20, 20 on the Edit Window grid.
<br><br>(115, 95) indicates that the bottom right hand corner of the dialog is at the position 115, 95 on the Edit Window
 grid.
<br><br>95x75 indicates the width and height of the dialog.
</dl>
<h4 id="Dialogs"> Dialogs </h4>
<dl>
<dt>Caption

 the application.&nbsp; Any changes you make to this field are not stored until you:
<ul>
<li><b> Press ENTER</b>, or
<li><b> Select the Set button</b> to the right of the field.
</ul>
<dt><br>Dlg Name
<dd>When the selected object is a dialog, this field contains the name of the dialog resource.&nbsp; This is the name by which
 the dialog is stored in the resource file.&nbsp; When you create a new dialog, the Dialog Editor assigns the default name
 DIALOG_# to the new dialog.&nbsp; You change the name of the dialog using the Dlg Name field.
<dl>
<dt>To change the dialogs name:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Type the new dialog name</b> using double quotes if the dialogs name is to be an character string.

<br>The symbol is a string used to specify the selected control.&nbsp; This is an alternate way to identify the control in
 your source code.
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Edit_Window"> The Edit Window </h3>
<br>The edit window is the window on which you create dialogs and controls.&nbsp; It represents the resource file that your
 dialog is a part of.
<br><br><tt><img src="dia9.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 104.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Dialog Editor edit window</b>
<br><br>The edit window gives you space so you can temporarily move controls off your dialog when it gets too crowded.&nbsp;
 For example, to rearrange controls in your dialog, you can drag them onto the edit window and then drag them back onto the
 dialog in the desired order.
<br><br>Although you can't see it on your screen, the edit window is an infinite grid with the origin (0,0) initially at its
 top left.&nbsp; Dialogs are always positioned relative to the edit window.&nbsp; The origin is in the middle of the world
 co-ordinate system, which is the reason the scroll thumbs are initially in the middle of the scroll bars.
<h3 id="The_Workspace"> The Workspace </h3>
<br>The workspace is the area under the Information Bar on which you can manipulate several resource files.&nbsp; This area
 can be compared to your desktop.&nbsp; For instance, if you minimize an edit window, an icon representing that edit window
 appears in the workspace.&nbsp; The workspace provides you with an area in which to open and close edit windows.

<h2 id="Dialog_Functions"> Dialog Functions </h2>
<br>This section describes the several functions you can perform with the Dialog Editor.&nbsp; The following tasks are included
 in this section:
<ul>
<li>Creating New Dialogs
<li>Opening Existing Dialogs
<li>Changing the Dialog Size
<li>Changing the Location of a Dialog
<li>Saving Dialogs
<li>Changing the Name of a Dialog
<li>Changing the Caption in a Dialog
<li>Adding Controls to a Dialog
<li>Modifying Controls in a Dialog
<li>Ordering Controls in a Dialog
</ul>
<h3 id="Creating_New_Dialogs"> Creating New Dialogs </h3>
<br>When you open the Dialog Editor, it displays an empty dialog box in the editor window of the Dialog Editor window.&nbsp;
 You can change the size and location of this dialog and add controls to it to meet the needs of your application.&nbsp; However,
 if you are not happy with the changes you have made and want to delete your dialog to start over again, or if you want to
 modify more than one dialog at a time, you can create another empty dialog in one of the following ways:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Select New</b> from the File menu.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select New</b> from the toolbar.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Draw another dialog</b> in the editor window with the &quot;dialog&quot; item from the toolbox.
</dl>
<br>An empty dialog named &quot;Untitled&quot; appears in the editor window.&nbsp; Now you can add controls to the empty dialog,
 and change its size and location within the edit window.
<h3 id="Opening_Existing_Dialogs"> Opening Existing Dialogs </h3>
<br>You can open a dialog from any .RES, .EXE, or .DLL file to your edit window where you can modify it.&nbsp; To do this:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Open the file you want,</b> in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Select Open from the file menu, or
<li>Select the Open button from the toolbar.
</ul>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select the .RES, .EXE, or .DLL file</b> that contains the dialog you want to copy.
<br>The Open Watcom Dialog Editor Open Resource dialog appears.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Select the resource file you want.</b>
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Select the name of the file you want,</b> in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Select the name and press OK, or
<li>Double click on the name of the file.
</ul>
<br>If there are any dialog resources in the file, the Select Dialog appears listing the names of all the dialog resources
 that exist in that resource file.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If the file does not contain any dialog resources, the main screen appears with an empty edit window and dialog for you to
 add controls and modify.
</dl>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Select one or more dialogs to place in the edit window</b> in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Double click on the dialogs you wish to modify, or
<li>Select the dialogs you wish to modify and select OK.
</ul>
<br>The dialog you copied appears in the edit window of your main screen.&nbsp; From here you can add controls to the dialog
 and modify its size and location.
</dl>
<h3 id="Changing_the_Dialog_Size"> Changing the Dialog Size </h3>
<br>To modify the size of a dialog,
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Select the dialog.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Position the mouse</b> above the appropriate sizing handle.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Drag the dialog's sizing handle</b> until the dialog is the size you want.
</dl>
<br>You will notice that the dialog size information in the Information Bar will track the size of the dialog.
<h3 id="Changing_the_Location_of_a_Dialog"> Changing the Location of a Dialog </h3>
<br>Since you will want all parts of your dialog to be visible to your users and grab their attention, you can modify the
 location of your dialog relative to the parent window.&nbsp; To do this:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Position the mouse</b> either above the dialog caption or within several pixels of the dialog's border (while remaining
 in the dialog).
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Drag the dialog</b> to the position you want in the edit window.
</dl>
<br>You will notice that the dialog size information in the Information Bar will track the location of the dialog.
<h3 id="Saving_Dialogs"> Saving Dialogs </h3>
<br>It is a good idea to save changes to your dialog as you modify it rather than wait for the Dialog Editor to prompt you
 when you close your dialog or exit the Dialog Editor.&nbsp; There are five ways to save dialogs.&nbsp; The two primary ways
 to save a dialog are to select one of the following from the file menu:
<ul>
<li>Save
<li>Save As
</ul>
<br>Selecting Save or Save As from the File menu saves the entire resource file in which your dialog resides, updating any
 changes you made to your dialog in the process.
<br><br>In addition, there are three other ways to save your dialog.&nbsp; You can choose Save, Save As, or Copy To from the
 Dialog menu.&nbsp; Saving a dialog from the Dialog menu only saves one resource - the currently selected dialog - not the
 entire resource file which typically contains numerous resources.
<dl>
<dt>Warning:
<dd>If you choose to select Save or Save As from the dialog menu you will only be saving the current dialog and not any of the
 other resources in the resource file.&nbsp; If you save the dialog under the same name as the resource file, you will overwrite
 all the resources in that file and be left with a resource file that contains nothing more than your dialog.
</dl>
<h3 id="Changing_the_Name_of_a_Dialog"> Changing the Name of a Dialog </h3>
<br>The name of a dialog is the name associated with the dialog resource when you save it to a dialog resource file.
<br><br>To avoid name conflicts, (you can't have two dialog resources with the same name, in the same file) you will want
 to change the name of your dialog (the editor gives you one as a default).&nbsp; Type in the edit field a name you want to
 give your dialog or, if symbols have been loaded, you can select a symbol from the combo box.&nbsp; You can drop down the
 combo list box and select a symbol from there.
<br><br><tt><img src="dia11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 106.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The combo box is labelled &quot;ID&quot;.</b>
<h3 id="Changing_the_Caption_in_a_Dialog"> Changing the Caption in a Dialog </h3>
<br>A dialog's caption is the text that appears in the title bar of the dialog.
<br><br>You can type in the edit field of the Information Bar to change the caption's name.
<h3 id="Adding_Controls_to_a_Dialog"> Adding Controls to a Dialog </h3>
<br>Select a tool that will allow you to create controls by selecting an item from the Tools menu or from the toolbox.
<br><br>There are two ways in which controls may be drawn in the dialog.
<dl>
<dt>
<dd><b> Click the left mouse button</b> at the position where you would like the top left corner of the control to be.&nbsp; The
 control will be created in its default size.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Press the left mouse button and drag out a rectangle.</b>&nbsp; Release the left mouse button.
</dl>
<br>The tool box goes back to select mode when you draw a control (the current tool becomes the select tool).
<br><br>To draw more than one of the same types of controls without having to choose the control from the toolbar or menu
 every time, choose the sticky tool which causes the tool to stay down.
<h3 id="Modifying_Controls_in_a_Dialog"> Modifying Controls in a Dialog </h3>
<br>Once you have created controls for your dialog you can modify the controls as follows:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Double-click the control.</b>
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select the control and Press ENTER.</b>
<br>A Style dialog box appears.
</dl>
<br>Once in the Dialog editor, you can define your dialog box.&nbsp; You can also add, change, group, reorder, move, resize,
 ore delete dialog controls so that your dialog box functions the way you want it to.
<h3 id="Ordering_Controls_in_a_Dialog"> Ordering Controls in a Dialog </h3>
<br>There is an ordering associated with the controls of a dialog.&nbsp; This ordering is commonly referred to as the &quot;tab
 order&quot; and controls which dialog control is highlighted next when you press the TAB or cursor keys.&nbsp; As you add
 controls to a dialog, they are added to the end of the list.
<br><br>The Dialog editor allows you to change this ordering using a simple &quot;point-and-click&quot; technique.&nbsp; To
 do this:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Select the dialog</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Set Order</b> from the Dialog Menu dialog
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Press the Set Order button</b> on the toolbar
<br>All of the controls in the dialog now have a button at their top-left corner indicating their current position.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click the dialog controls</b> in order until the ordering is what you would like.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Select Set Order</b> from the Dialog Menu dialog
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Press the Set Order button</b> on the toolbar
<br>Reselecting Set Order will terminate the ordering session and record any changes made.
</dl>
<br>As you click the dialog controls you will notice two things.&nbsp; First, the buttons at the dialog controls top-left
 take on a &quot;depressed&quot; look.&nbsp; This indicates a button you have already clicked.&nbsp; Second, the unselected
 or unclicked buttons will reorder themselves to reflect any changes you have made so far.&nbsp; This will allow you terminate
 the ordering session without having to click all of the dialogs controls.
<br><br>Clicking on a dialog control that is in the &quot;depressed&quot; or selected state will undo the new ordering you
 have given it and it will go back to its original position.&nbsp; If a &quot;depressed&quot; dialog control already has its
 original position then it finds the first available position.&nbsp; This feature is handy if you make a mistake and would
 like to perform a quick fix.
<br><br>There may be a point in the ordering process where you decide to start over from the beginning.&nbsp; Instead of clicking
 over all the dialog controls you have previously clicked or leaving and then re-entering the Set Order mode you may simply
 double click the dialog control you wish to be first.&nbsp; This will undo all that you have done and make the selected dialog
 control the first one.
<br><br>You may run into a situation where the first n dialog controls are correctly ordered but subsequent one are not.&nbsp;
 Before you begin to click through the first n dialog controls note that there is a better way.&nbsp; Simply shift-click the
 n'th control to accept the current ordering up to that point and proceed.
<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Image_Editor"> The Open Watcom Image Editor </h1>
<br>If you want to design visual resources such as bitmaps, icons, or cursors and add sizzle to your application's interface,
 the image editor can help.
<br><br>The Image Editor is a visually oriented drawing tool with the power to draw all the visual resources you want - exactly
 the way you picture them.&nbsp; This way, you can design effective bitmaps, meaningful icons, and communicative cursors.
<br><br>Of course, the Image Editor can help bring to life your new artistic achievements.&nbsp; But it can also copy visual
 images from anything else you can see on your computer screen.&nbsp; For example, if you would like to incorporate a favorite
 bitmap or icon from your desktop or even from another application, you can use the Image Editor's Screen Select option to
 copy that image to your design grid where you can tailor the image to your exact specifications.&nbsp; Then, when you are
 happy with your visual image, you can save it to an executable.
<br><br>Most of the sections in this chapter apply to all your visuals, but for more information on the specific type of visual
 you are creating, see the sections specific to creating and editing your specific resource type.
<br><br>This chapter contains the following:
<ul>
<li>Opening the Image Editor
<li>Closing the Image Editor
<li>The Main Screen
<li>The Image Editor Menu Bar
<li>The Image Editor Toolbar
<li>The Image Editor Toolbox
<li>The Image Editor Color Palette

<br>When you close the Image Editor, it remembers the size and position of its main window, as well as the position of the
 toolbar and color palette.&nbsp; It also remembers whether the toolbar and color palette were hidden or not.&nbsp; This way,
 when you open the Image Editor again, it is set up the same way you left it.
<h2 id="The_Main_Screen"> The Main Screen </h2>
<br>Every time you open the Image Editor, the Open Watcom Image Editor window appears.&nbsp; The toolbar, toolbox, and color

<br><b><i>Figure 107.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Image Editor window</b>
<br><br>You cannot draw or copy images onto the screen itself.&nbsp; Instead, you must first create a design grid, a work
 area on which you can design your visuals.&nbsp; You can create an empty design grid and draw your own visual or you can
 create a design grid with an image from your desktop or another application already on it.&nbsp; Once you have an image on
 your design grid you can edit it so it looks exactly the way you want.
<h3 id="Creating_a_Design_Grid"> Creating a Design Grid </h3>

<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>A dialog box appears where you specify the image size you want to work with.&nbsp; The Image Editor automatically defaults
 to the standard sizes (in pixels) for bitmaps, icons, and cursors.&nbsp; To create different sized images, simply enter the
 desired pixel width and height.

<h2 id="The_Image_Editor_Menu_Bar"> The Image Editor Menu Bar </h2>
<br>The menu bar along the top of the Image Editor window allows you to access most of the items in the toolbar, the toolbox,
 and the color palette.&nbsp; It also provides you with other items that you cannot access anywhere else except on the menu
 bar.
<br><br><tt><img src="img2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 108.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Image Editor menu bar</b>

 item appears in the status line.&nbsp; For more information about the status line, see the section entitled <a href="#The_Image_Editor_Status_Line">The Image Editor Status Line</a>.
&nbsp; This manual assumes that you know how to use the menus and are familiar with common menu items such as Save As and
 Undo.
<br><br>Some of the menu items have accelerator keys, also called accelerators, so you can invoke an item without having to
 pull down the menu.&nbsp; This means, for example, that you can start a new image in three ways.&nbsp; You can either:
<ul>
<li>Select the new image button from the toolbar, or
<li>Choose New from the File menu, or
<li>Press F2 (the accelerator for starting a new image).

<h2 id="The_Image_Editor_Color_Palette"> The Image Editor Color Palette </h2>
<br>If you want to draw or fill a new visual in different colors, or change the colors of an existing bitmap, icon, or cursor,
 the color palette allows you to select the colors you want.
<br><br><tt><img src="img5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 111.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Image Editor color palette</b>
<dl>
<dt>To select a color:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click either the left or right mouse button on the color</b> in the color palette that you wish to assign to that button.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select a drawing tool.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Draw or fill</b> holding down the mouse button assigned to the color you want.
</dl>
<br>For example, if you want to draw a red line:
<ol>
<li>Create a design grid for the resource you want
<li>Select a shade of red from the color palette.
<li>Select the line tool from the toolbox.
<li>Drag your cursor across the design grid.
</ol>
<br>When you choose one of the 12 colors on the right of the color palette, the draw color will not be the same as the fill
 color.&nbsp; Don't be alarmed.&nbsp; This is because they are not true VGA colors.&nbsp; The Image Editor creates them by
 dithering two or more colors together so that, while the color appears solid in the view window, it is actually made up of
 different colored pixels intermingled with each other.&nbsp; Since it is impossible to represent a single pixel-unit of a
 dithered color, the draw color always differs from the fill color when you select a dithered color.
<h3 id="Selecting_Screen_and_Inverse_Colors"> Selecting Screen and Inverse Colors </h3>
<br>Unlike simple bitmaps, visuals such as icons and cursors usually require transparent or inverse colors.&nbsp; This is
 so that they don't entirely obscure everything underneath them and so they can be seen no matter what color they happen to
 be sitting on.
<br><br>When you create or edit an icon or cursor, you can choose the screen and inverse colors from the color palette.&nbsp;
 Then, you can draw portions of your icon or cursor with those colors, so that these pixels blend into the background of your
 application.
<br><br>Remember, if you want to use a specific color in your icon or cursor, make sure the color you want to use is not the
 screen or inverse color.&nbsp; Reserve these two colors for drawing only the transparent portions of your icon or cursor.
&nbsp; And use the other 26 colors available in the color palette for regular drawing.
<dl>
<dt>To choose a screen color:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Create a design grid</b> for a cursor or icon.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Move your cursor</b> over the two squares beside the words Screen and Inverse, so that your cursor changes from a pointer
 to a hand.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Double click on either square.</b>
<br>The Select Screen Color dialog appears.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Select the color</b> you want to use as your screen color.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>The dialog closes and the screen color and its inverse are assigned to the screen and inverse boxes in the color palette.
&nbsp; These will be the Screen and Inverse colors you can use to draw the portions of your icon or cursor that you want to
 be transparent.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>When you select a color, its inverse is automatically selected for you.&nbsp; Try to find a screen color and inverse color
 that you won't want to use in the foreground of your icon or cursor.&nbsp; For example, if you don't intend to use yellow
 in your icon, select yellow as your screen color.&nbsp; The inverse color, blue, is automatically selected for you, so if
 you intend to use blue in your icon, find another screen color that doesn't have blue as its inverse.
</dl>
</dl>
<h3 id="Assigning_Colors_to_Mouse_Buttons"> Assigning Colors to Mouse Buttons </h3>
<br>When you are drawing and filling in multiple colors, you may find it useful to assign colors to the left and right mouse
 buttons.&nbsp; This way, you can draw in one color, and quickly switch to another color simply by pressing the opposite mouse
 button.&nbsp; For example, if you find you draw mostly in black and red, assign black to the left mouse button and red to
 the right mouse button.&nbsp; To do this,
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Select the black square</b> by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select the red square</b> by clicking on it with the right mouse button.
<br>The colors assigned to the mouse buttons appear in the squares of the color palette marked L (for left) and R (for right).
</dl>
<h3 id="Hiding_and_Showing_the_Color_Palette"> Hiding and Showing the Color Palette </h3>
<br>If you generally only draw in one or two colors or temporarily need more room on your screen, you can hide the color palette:
<ul>
<li>Double click on the system menu icon in the corner of the Color Palette, or
<li>Choose Show Color Palette from the Options menu.
</ul>
<br>To reveal the color palette again, choose Show Color Palette again from the Options menu.
<h2 id="The_Image_Editor_Status_Line"> The Image Editor Status Line </h2>
<br>There are five sections in the status line.&nbsp; The first four sections provide information on the current image.&nbsp;
 The fifth section displays hint text for the items in the menus, toolbar, and toolbox when you position your cursor over
 an item and hold down the mouse button.

<h2 id="Creating_and_Editing_Bitmaps"> Creating and Editing Bitmaps </h2>
<br>If you want your applications to have visual impact, you can create and edit bitmaps.&nbsp; Bitmaps are graphical images
 that can be as large as 512 x 512 square pixels representing such things as buttons, brush patterns, company logos, toolbar
 items, wallpaper, and graphical elements in menus.
<br><br>Using the Image Editor you can create a new bitmap or you can create a bitmap from any other image on your desktop.
&nbsp; You can even copy a bitmap from another application on your desktop.
<dl>
<dt>To create a new bitmap:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose New</b> from the File menu.
<br>The Image Type dialog appears.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Bitmap.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>The Bitmap Information dialog appears.&nbsp; This dialog prompts you for information about the dimensions of the bitmap
 you want to create and the color scheme you want to work with.&nbsp; The Image Editor defaults to the dimensions most commonly
 used for creating bitmaps, 32 pixels by 32 pixels.&nbsp; However, if you want to create a different sized bitmap, enter the
 pixel width and height you want.&nbsp; The Image Editor also defaults to a 256-Color color scheme.&nbsp; Other color schemes
 available are 16-Color VGA and 2-Color Monochrome.
</dl>
<br>To copy a bitmap from your desktop or from another application on your desktop:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose New</b> from the File menu.
<br>The Image Type dialog appears.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Bitmap.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>The Bitmap Information dialog appears.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Select the Screen Select button.</b>
<br>This option allows you to choose the size and contents of the newly created bitmap with images from your desktop or from
 another application sitting on your desktop.&nbsp; The Image Editor ignores the limitations specified in the Bitmap Information
 dialog and uses the dimensions you sweep out (up to 512x512 pixels).
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Position the cursor at the image you want to select.</b>
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Hold the left mouse button and drag the cursor</b> across the image you want to copy to your design grid.
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Release the mouse button.</b>
<br>The image you selected appears on your design grid.
</dl>
<h2 id="Creating_and_Editing_Cursors"> Creating and Editing Cursors </h2>
<br>You can create and edit cursors that communicate to your users the mode or state of the application.
<br><br>You can create a new cursor or you can create an empty cursor and copy an image from your desktop or another application
 onto your design grid.&nbsp; From there you can edit your cursor's appearance and set its hot spot.
<br><br>When you edit cursors, the Image Editor provides you with an extra tool called<b> Set Hotspot</b> This tool allows
 you to select the exact pixel to which you want to assign the hotspot.&nbsp; The default hotspot is 0,0 (at the top left
 corner of the design grid).
<br><br><tt><img src="img7.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 113.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Set Hotspot tool allows you to select the hotspot</b>
<dl>
<dt>To create a new cursor:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose New</b> from the File menu.
<br>The Image Type dialog appears.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Cursor.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>The Cursor Format dialog box appears.&nbsp; Since cursors should be standardized, you can only choose monochrome cursors
 32x32 pixels.&nbsp; You cannot create a colored cursor.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
</dl>
<br>Cursors (and icons, too) differ from bitmaps in that they almost always include pixels that blend into the background
 of your application.&nbsp; Unless you want a rectangular shaped cursor, you must assign special screen and inverse colors
 to the &quot;blending pixels,&quot; so that they don't obscure the areas over which you move the cursor.
<br><br>Since you can only create black and white cursors, do not use black or white as your screen or inverse colors.&nbsp;
 Instead, use one of the dithered colors as your screen color.&nbsp; The Image Editor automatically chooses the inverse of
 the chosen dithered color.
<br><br>For more information on selecting screen and inverse colors, refer to the section entitled <a href="#Selecting_Screen_and_Inverse_Colors">Selecting Screen and Inverse Colors</a>.
<h2 id="Creating_and_Editing_Icons"> Creating and Editing Icons </h2>
<br>With the Image Editor, you can create icons that look exactly the way you want.&nbsp; Icons are usually the user's first
 exposure to your application, so you want them to be as professional and meaningful as possible.
<br><br>You can create a new icon or you can create an empty icon design grid and use the Image Editor's Snap Bitmap option
 to copy an image from your desktop to your design grid where you can edit it as desired.
<dl>
<dt>To create a new icon:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose New</b> from the File menu.
<br>The Image Type dialog appears.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Icon.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>The Icon Target dialog box appears.&nbsp; You can create the following types of icons:
<ul>
<li>16-color 32x32
<li>2-color 32x32
<li>2-color 32x16
<li>16-color 16x16
<li>2-color 16x16
<li>256-color 48x48
<li>16-color 48x48
<li>16-color 24x24
</ul>
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Select the desired icon type.</b>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>The Image Editor window displays an empty icon design grid awaiting your new creation.
</dl>
<br>If you want to copy an image from your desktop or from another application sitting on your desktop, select the Snap Bitmap
 option from the toolbar and drag across the image on your desktop that you want to copy.
<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_Menu_Editor"> The Open Watcom Menu Editor </h1>
<br>Windows applications typically contain menus that enable users to initiate actions.&nbsp; When users see familiar menus
 in the menu bar, such as the File or Edit menu, they may feel less intimidated by a new application and be more apt to explore
 its capabilities.
<br><br>In an application you can have three types of menu items:
<ul>
<li>Standard
<li>Popup
<li>Separator
</ul>
<br>A standard menu item performs a function when selected.&nbsp; A popup menu item is a menu item with a sub-menu.&nbsp;
 Selecting a popup menu reveals another menu list, rather than performing a function.&nbsp; A separator is a horizontal line
 that separates groups of menu items within a popup menu.&nbsp; A resource file can have multiple menus.
<br><br>The Open Watcom Menu Editor enables you to create new menus and edit existing menus found in resource files.&nbsp;
 A resource file may contain multiple menus.
<br><br>With the Menu Editor you can create all of the menus needed for your application visually, without having to create
 a resource script or use a resource compiler.
<h2 id="Using_the_Menu_Editor"> Using the Menu Editor </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Starting the Menu Editor
<li>Quitting the Menu Editor
<li>The Menu Editor Menu Bar

</ul>
<h3 id="Starting_the_Menu_Editor"> Starting the Menu Editor </h3>
<br>The Menu Editor may be invoked in one of two ways.&nbsp; The first involves first starting the Resource Editor then starting
 the Menu Editor.&nbsp; The second way the editor may be started is from the Open Watcom IDE.
<br><br>To start the Menu Editor from the Resource Editor, you must first open the Resource Editor.&nbsp; How you proceed
 depends on whether you are opening a new (empty) menu table or an existing menu table.

<h3 id="Menu_Editor__Resource_Name_Field"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Resource Name Field </h3>
<br>The Resource Name field in the Open Watcom Menu Editor window contains the name of the menu currently being edited.&nbsp;
 A resource file can contain more than one menu, so it is important that the resource names for the menu resources be unique.
&nbsp; The Resource Name field is not case sensitive and can hold up to 255 characters.&nbsp; You can enter a textual name,
 a number or a symbol in this field.
<br><br>When you create a new menu, the Resource Editor assigns the default name MENU_# to it.&nbsp; You can rename the menu
 using the Rename item in the Resource menu.
<h3 id="Menu_Editor__The_Preview_Window"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; The Preview Window </h3>
<br>The Preview window appears on the Menu Editor window above the menu item list.&nbsp; This window allows you to see how
 the menu you are creating will look in the application.&nbsp; The popup menu items in the preview window are functional so
 you can test your menu as you create it.
<br><br><tt><img src="mnu5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 118.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The preview window allows you to see how the menu will look and work in the

<br><br>You can use the sample menu that appears in the preview window to test the behaviour of your menu items.&nbsp; For
 example, by selecting top-level menu items in the preview window you can check the positions and breaks of your menu items
 and separators.&nbsp; The preview window allows you to verify that your menus cascade properly and that other attributes
 function properly, including inactive, grayed, and check marked menu items.
<h3 id="Menu_Editor__Attributes_Area"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Attributes Area </h3>
<br>The attributes area provides information about the currently selected menu item.&nbsp; You can edit menu items using only
 the fields in this area.
<br><br>The attributes area displays menu item details in five sections.&nbsp; Following is an explanation of each section.
<dl>
<dt>Item Text
<dd>The Item Text field contains the name of the menu item.&nbsp; Whatever appears in this field will appear in the menu.
<br>An ampersand (&amp;) in front of a letter in this field tells the editor to underscore that letter in the menu.&nbsp;
 This automatically creates a hot key for that menu item.&nbsp; When using the menu, pressing ALT plus the underscored letter
 activates that menu item.
<br><br>To specify a tab character, enter \t in this field.&nbsp; All text after \t in the Item Text field will be right justified
 in the menu.
<dt><br>Item ID
<dd>The Item ID is the unique numeric identifier for the menu item.&nbsp; In the source code, you match the identifier to the
 function the menu item is to perform.&nbsp; The Item ID applies only to normal menu items.&nbsp; Popups and separators do
 not perform functions, so do not need an identifier.
<br>You can enter any number in the range 0 to 65535 in the Item ID field.&nbsp; Hexadecimal values can be entered by prefixing
 them with 0x.&nbsp; Octal values can be entered by prefixing them with zero.
<br><br>The two Item ID fields contain:
<ul>
<li>the numeric identifier of the selected menu item
<li>the symbol information for the selected menu item.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Both Menu Item fields currently contain the same numerical information because the Menu Editor does not yet support symbols.
</dl>
<dt><br>Item Type
<dd>The Item Type section of the window indicates whether the selected menu item is a popup, normal, or separator menu item.&nbsp;
 Following is a description of each menu item type.
<dl>
<dt>Popup
<dd>A popup menu is a menu item that has a sub-menu.&nbsp; When you select a popup menu, another menu appears.
<dt><br>Normal
<dd>A normal menu item is an item that performs a function when selected.
<dt><br>Separator
<dd>A separator menu item is a horizontal line that separates menu items to logically group menu items with similar functions.
&nbsp; When a separator is selected from the menu item list, the Item Text and Item ID fields are always empty because they
 do not apply to separators.
</dl>
<dt><br>Attributes
<dd>The options in the Attributes section allow you to specify how the selected menu item will appear in the menu.&nbsp; Use the
 check boxes to select the desired menu item characteristic.&nbsp; Following is a description of each option.
<dl>
<dt>Checked
<dd>When the Checked option is selected, the menu item appears in the menu with a check mark beside it.&nbsp; This is a graphic
 only and does not affect the functionality of the menu item.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Top level menu items cannot be checked.
</dl>
<dt><br>Grayed
<dd>When the Grayed option is selected, the menu item text appears in gray instead of black.&nbsp; This option also makes the
 menu item inactive.
<dt><br>Inactive
<dd>When the Inactive option is selected, the menu item appears unchanged in the menu.&nbsp; However, this option prevents the
 menu item from being selected.
</dl>
<dt><br>Break Styles
<dd>The options in the Break Styles section control the positioning of the menu items.&nbsp; The break styles you choose affects
 the selected menu item and all menu items that follow that item.&nbsp; Following is a description of the available options.
<dl>
<dt>Help
<dd>The Help break option positions the selected menu to the far right of the menu bar.&nbsp; This option is available only for
 top-level menus.
<dt><br>Menu
<dd>For top-level menu items, the Menu break option begins a new line in the menu bar, positioning the selected menu item on the
 far left.&nbsp; In a popup menu, this break option creates a new column, positioning the selected menu item at the beginning
 of the new column.
<dl>
<dt>Note
<dd>The Menu option overrides the Menu Bar option.
</dl>
<dt><br>Menu Bar
<dd>For top-level menu items, the Menu Bar break option performs the same function as the Menu break option.&nbsp; In a popup
 menu, the Menu Bar break option creates a new column, beginning with the selected menu item and places a vertical line between
 the columns.
</dl>
</dl>
<h3 id="Menu_Editor__Menu_Item_List"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Menu Item List </h3>
<br>The menu item list displays the menu items in the current menu.&nbsp; Use this list to view the attributes of the menu
 items listed.&nbsp; Select a menu item from the table by clicking on it.&nbsp; Details of the selected menu item appear in
 the attributes area of the window.
<h3 id="Menu_Editor__Action_Buttons"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Action Buttons </h3>
<br>The action buttons control how the information in the attributes area is handled by the editor.&nbsp; The Insert button
 will use the contents of the attributes area to create a new entry in the menu.&nbsp; The Change button will use the contents
 of the attributes area to modify the current entry in the menu.&nbsp; The &lt;&lt; (shift left) button will cause the current
 menu item to become a subitem of its parent.&nbsp; This button is enabled only when the current item is the last item in
 its parent menu.&nbsp; The current item will visually appear to shift left.&nbsp; The &gt;&gt; (shift right) button will
 cause the current menu item to become the last subitem of the popup menu preceding it.&nbsp; This button is enabled only
 when the item preceding the current item is a popup menu.&nbsp; The current item will visually appear to shift right.&nbsp;
 The Reset button will discard the contents of the attributes area and reset them to those of the current entry in the menu.
&nbsp; The Insert button is the default button when the ENTER key is pressed and no other button has the focus.
<h2 id="Menu_Functions"> Menu Functions </h2>
<br>You can perform several functions with the Menu Editor.&nbsp; This section describes the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Adding a New Menu Item
<li>Changing an Existing Menu Item
<li>Deleting Menu Items
<li>Renaming a Menu
<li>Saving Menu Items
<li>Using Shortcuts to Create Menus
<li>Changing Memory Options
</ul>
<h3 id="Adding_a_New_Menu_Item"> Adding a New Menu Item </h3>
<br>The steps for adding a new menu item to a menu are the same, regardless of whether the menu item list is empty or already
 contains menu items.&nbsp; Follow these steps to add a new menu item.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Enter the text for the menu item</b> in the Item Text field.
<br>To set one of the letters as a hot key, insert an ampersand (&amp;) directly in front of that letter.&nbsp; The letter
 marked as the hot key key appears underlined in the menu item text.&nbsp; For example, to add the menu item<tt> Cut</tt>
 with the letter<tt> t</tt> as its hot key, enter<tt> Cu&amp;t</tt> in the Item Text field.
<br><br>To have text in the menu item appear right justified, enter the code \t in the Item Text field.&nbsp; For example,
 to add the entry<tt> Open</tt> with the accelerator<tt> Ctrl+O</tt> right justified, enter<tt> Open\tCtrl+O</tt> in the Item
 Text field.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter a symbol or numeric identifier</b> for the menu item.
<br>The identifier in this field is the unique identifier associated with the menu item.&nbsp; You define the relationship
 between the menu item function and this identifier in the source code for your application.
<br><br>You must enter a value between 0 and 65535 in this field.&nbsp; Hexadecimal values can be entered by prefixing them
 with 0x.&nbsp; Octal values can be entered by prefixing the with zero.

<h3 id="Saving_Menu_Items"> Saving Menu Items </h3>
<br>There are three functions you can use to save menus with the Menu Editor:
<ul>
<li>Update
<li>Save As
<li>Copy To
</ul>
<br>Each of these options performs a different type of save function.&nbsp; This section describes how to use each function.
<h4 id="Menu_Editor__Update"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Update </h4>
<br>After modifying a menu item in a menu, choose Update from the File menu on the Menu Editor window to save the updated
 menu to the current resource file.&nbsp; This prevents the changes from being lost when you exit the Menu Editor.
<br><br>The Update function updates the resource file only at the resource level.&nbsp; The resource file is not saved until
 you perform a save at the Resource Editor level as well.&nbsp; Exiting the Resource Editor without saving causes you to lose
 any the menu changes made.
<h4 id="Menu_Editor__Save_As"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Save As </h4>
<br>Choose Save As from the File menu on the Menu Editor window to save the current menu to another resource file.&nbsp; A
 Save Menu dialog appears where you specify the resource file to which you want to save the current menu.
<br><br><tt><img src="mnu8.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 121.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Save Menu dialog, specify the resource file to which you want to save
 the menu.</b>
<dl>
<dt>Important:
<dd>If the resource file to which you are saving the menu already contains resources, the existing resources will be discarded
 and replaced with the menu you are saving.
</dl>
<h4 id="Menu_Editor__Copy_To"> Menu Editor:&nbsp; Copy To </h4>
<br>Choose Copy To from the Resource menu on the Menu Editor window to copy the current menu item list into an existing resource
 file.&nbsp; A Copy To dialog appears where you specify the resource file to which you want to copy the current menu item
 list.&nbsp; Unlike the Save As function, copying a menu item list to a resource file adds an entry to the list of resources
 rather than replacing the existing resources with the new entry.
<br><br><tt><img src="mnu9.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 122.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Copy To dialog, specify the resource file to which you want to copy

<h3 id="Using_Shortcuts_to_Create_menus"> Using Shortcuts to Create menus </h3>
<br>The Edit menu on the Open Watcom Menu Editor window contains some standard Windows options that you can use to quickly
 create menu resources.&nbsp; The options are:
<ul>
<li>Cut
<li>Copy
<li>Paste
</ul>
<br>These options allow you to perform functions on menus but not on individual menu items.

 beside the field.&nbsp; Following is a description of each option.
<dl>
<dt>Moveable
<dd>Selecting this option marks this menu to be stored in moveable memory when it is loaded by an application.
<dt><br>Discardable
<dd>Selecting this option marks this menu to be stored in discardable memory when it is loaded by an application.
<dt><br>Pure
<dd>When marked as Pure, Windows will not allow the memory that the menu is loaded into to be modified.
<dt><br>Preload
<dd>All menus marked as Preload will be loaded when the application for which you are creating the menu is loaded.
<dt><br>LoadOnCall
<dd>Menus marked as LoadOnCall will be loaded when an application issues a call to load them.

<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> when all memory option selections are made.
<br>The Memory Options dialog closes returning you to the Menu Editor window.
</dl>
<h1 id="The_Open_Watcom_String_Editor"> The Open Watcom String Editor </h1>
<br>To group together text strings in your application, you can use string tables.&nbsp; A string table is a list of strings
 such as error messages, prompts, and other text you want your application to display.&nbsp; Each string in the string table
 has a unique number, called an identifier, associated with it.&nbsp; When the application presents the user with a message,
 it searches for the appropriate identifier and displays the associated string, regardless of the textual content of the string.
<br><br>The Open Watcom String Editor enables you to create string tables for your application.&nbsp; The String Editor stores
 these tables in the resource file.&nbsp; You can have multiple string tables in a resource file, which allows you to logically
 group the text strings for your application.&nbsp; Since a string table is simply another Windows resource that is separate
 from the source code, you can use the String Editor to do such things as translate your strings into another language or
 make your strings more concise without having to change the source code.
<h2 id="Using_the_String_Editor"> Using the String Editor </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Starting the String Editor
<li>Quitting the String Editor
<li>The String Editor Menu Bar
<li>The String Editor Toolbar
</ul>
<h3 id="Starting_the_String_Editor"> Starting the String Editor </h3>
<br>The String Editor may be invoked in one of two ways.&nbsp; The first involves first starting the Resource Editor then
 starting the String Editor.&nbsp; The second way the editor may be started is from the Open Watcom IDE.
<br><br>To start the String Editor from the Resource Editor, you must first open the Resource Editor.&nbsp; How you proceed
 depends on whether you are opening a new (empty) string table or an existing string table.&nbsp; The String Editor works
 on resources found in resource files.
<br><br><tt><img src="str1.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

&nbsp; Choose Yes to save the changes and exit the String Editor, No to exit the String Editor without saving the changes,
 or Cancel to return to the String Editor.
<br><br>When you exit the String Editor, the application remembers the directory in which you last opened or saved a string
 table (not the resource file).&nbsp; The next time you open a string table, the last directory accessed appears in the File
 Selection dialog so you do not have to reenter its path.&nbsp; This feature makes the String Editor more convenient and efficient
 to use.
<h3 id="The_String_Editor_Menu_Bar"> The String Editor Menu Bar </h3>
<br><tt><img src="str2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

<br>The String Text field in the Open Watcom String Editor window contains the text for the string item you are defining.
&nbsp; Whatever appears in this field will appear in your application.
<h3 id="String_ID_Field"> String ID Field </h3>
<br>The two String ID fields contains:
<ul>
<li>the identifier associated with the string item
<li>the symbol information for the specified string
</ul>
<br>Creating a string item automatically creates a relationship between the string item and its identifier, the String ID.
&nbsp; In your source code you reference the string item by its String ID.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Both String ID fields currently contain the same numerical information because the String Editor does not yet support symbols.
</dl>
<h3 id="String_Editor__Action_Buttons"> String Editor:&nbsp; Action Buttons </h3>
<br>The action buttons control how the information in the attributes area is handled by the editor.&nbsp; The Insert button
 will use the contents of the attributes area to create a new entry in the string table.&nbsp; The Change button will use
 the contents of the attributes area to modify the current entry in the string table.&nbsp; The Reset button will discard
 the contents of the attributes area and reset them to those of the current entry in the string table.&nbsp; The Insert button
 is the default button when the ENTER key is pressed and no other button has the focus.
<h3 id="Strings_List"> Strings List </h3>
<br>The Strings list displays all of the string items in the current string table.&nbsp; The string items appear in ascending
 numerical order by String ID.

<h3 id="Differences_from_IBM_Resource_Compiler"> Differences from IBM Resource Compiler </h3>
<br>Open Watcom Resource Compiler is largely compatible with IBM's OS/2 Resource Compiler, but there are some differences.
<dl>
<dt>Octal constants
<dd>Open Watcom Resource Compiler recogizes octal constants such as 007, 056 etc.&nbsp; Hence values such as 008 are considered
 to be an error.&nbsp; This is consistent with IBM's RC version 5 and also consistent with the C/C++ language.&nbsp; In resource
 files that need to be portable between RC versions, do not use octal constants and strip all leading zeros.
<dt><br>Expression parsing
<dd>There are differences in parsing statements such as
<br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #define IDR_ACCEL&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IDR_ACCEL&nbsp; -1,&nbsp; 8, 40,&nbsp;&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; 0</tt>
<br><br>Older versions of IBM RC consider 'IDR_ACCEL' and '-1' to be separate tokens while Open Watcom Resource Compiler considers
 them to be a single arithmetic expression.&nbsp; This is consistent with IBM's RC version 5.&nbsp; The correct and unambiguous
 syntax is as follows:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IDR_ACCEL, -1,&nbsp; 8, 40,&nbsp;&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; 0</tt>
<dt><br>Binary resource files
<dd>Using the -zm switch, Open Watcom Resource Compiler produces resource files compatible with those that IBM RC produces, however,
 the files are not always identical.&nbsp; In particular the ordering of dialog data within binary resource files is not always
 the same between Open Watcom Resource Compiler and IBM RC.&nbsp; This has no effect on the semantics of such resource files.

<h2 id="Using_the_Open_Watcom_Resource_Compiler"> Using the Open Watcom Resource Compiler </h2>
<br>The command WRC is used to start the Open Watcom Resource Compiler.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Resource Compiler may be used
 in a number of different ways:
<ul>
<li>To compile a resource definition file and add the resulting resources to the executable.
<br><br>WRC is used as follows to accomplish this:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc &#91;options&#93; resource-definition-file &#91;executable-file&#93;</tt>
<br><br>The resource-definition-file must not have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;, &quot;.EXE&quot;, &quot;.SCR&quot;, &quot;.DLL&quot;
 or &quot;.DRV&quot;.&nbsp; If no extension is specified for the executable-file then &quot;.EXE&quot; is assumed.&nbsp; If
 executable-file is specified without an extension but is terminated with a period (&quot;.&quot;) then the default extension
 is not added.&nbsp; If the executable-file is not specified then its value defaults to the filename specified for the resource-definition-file
 with its extension changed to &quot;.EXE&quot;.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc life.rc</tt>
<li>To compile resources separately.
<br><br>This causes the Open Watcom Resource Compiler to create a<tt> .RES</tt> file only.&nbsp; WRC is used as follows to
 accomplish this:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc -r &#91;options&#93; resource-definition-file &#91;output-file&#93;</tt>
<br><br>The resource-definition-file must not have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;, &quot;.EXE&quot;, &quot;.SCR&quot;, &quot;.DLL&quot;
 or &quot;.DRV&quot;.&nbsp; If no extension is specified for the output-file then &quot;.RES&quot; is assumed.&nbsp; If output-file
 is specified without an extension but is terminated with a period (&quot;.&quot;) then the default extension is not added.
&nbsp; If the output-file is not specified then its value defaults to the filename specified for the resource-definition-file
 with its extension changed to &quot;.RES&quot;.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc -r -bt=nt life.rc</tt>
<li>To add a compiled resource file to an executable file.
<br><br>WRC is used as follows to accomplish this:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc &#91;options&#93; resource-file &#91;executable-file&#93;</tt>
<br><br>The resource-file must have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;.&nbsp; The defaults for the executable-file parameter are
 the same as in the case of compiling a resource definition file and adding the results to an executable.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc life.res</tt>
<li>To add multiple compiled resource files to an executable file.
<br><br>WRC is used as follows to accomplish this:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc &#91;options&#93; res-file &#91;executable-file&#93; -fr=res-file-2 ...</tt>
<br><br>The resource files must have the extension &quot;.RES&quot;.&nbsp; The defaults for the executable-file parameter
 are the same as in the case of compiling a resource definition file and adding the results to an executable.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc life.res life.exe -fr wave.res</tt>
<li>To compile an application that does not have a resource file.
<br><br>This is useful if you wish to set the Windows 3.x or Win32 version number, or sort load the segments (Windows 3.x),
 or use any of the other executable modifying features of Open Watcom Resource Compiler.&nbsp; WRC is used as follows to accomplish
 this:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc &#91;options&#93; executable-file</tt>
<br><br>The file specified for executable-file specified must have a &quot;.EXE&quot;, &quot;.SCR&quot;, &quot;.DLL&quot;
 or &quot;.DRV&quot; extension.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrc -30 life.exe</tt>

<h2 id="Zoom_Operations"> Zoom Operations </h2>
<br>There are a number of functions you can perform with Zoom, including zooming, resizing the window, and pasting magnified
 screen sections to the clipboard.&nbsp; This section describes each Zoom function.
<h3 id="Zooming"> Zooming </h3>
<br>The following procedures describe the standard steps you perform to zoom.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Position the mouse pointer in the Zoom window.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</b> outside of the Zoom window.
<br>Attached to the cursor is a box which acts as a magnifier.&nbsp; As you move the mouse, the screen sections over which
 you drag this magnifier appear magnified in the Zoom window.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Position the magnifier on top of the screen area</b> you want to capture in magnification.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Release the mouse button.</b>
<br>Zoom captures the selected screen section in the Zoom window in magnification.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Make fine adjustments,</b> such as centering the captured image, using the scroll bars of the Zoom window.
<br>Scrolling is a standard Windows feature.&nbsp; However, with Zoom, you can see the magnifier move on the screen as you
 scroll the captured image in the Zoom window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Resizing_the_Zoom_Window"> Resizing the Zoom Window </h3>
<br>Resizing the Zoom window can be done at two different times:&nbsp; before you zoom an area or while you are zooming an
 area.
<br><br>Resizing the window before you zoom is a standard Windows operation.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Position the cursor on the border of the window</b> until it turns into a double-pointed arrow.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</b> until the window is the desired size.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Release the mouse button.</b>
</dl>
<br>While positioning the magnifier over an area of the screen to select it for magnification, you may find you want to increase
 or decrease the size of the area you capture.
<dl>
<dt>To resize the window while zooming:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Position the cursor in the Zoom window.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</b> outside of the Zoom window.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Position the magnifier</b> over the desired screen area to select.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Press the right mouse button</b> while continuing to hold down the left mouse button.
<br>If the Sticky Magnifier option is activated, you do not need to hold down the left mouse button.&nbsp; For details on
 the Sticky Magnifier option, refer to the section entitled <a href="#Configuring_Zoom">Configuring Zoom</a>.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Move the mouse to increase or decrease the size</b> of the magnifier.
<br>There is a maximum and minimum size for the magnifier.&nbsp; The resizing interaction is similar to resizing a regular
 window.&nbsp; The Zoom window does not change in size until you release the right mouse button.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Release the right mouse button</b> when the magnifier is the desired size.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>When resizing the window while zooming, the Zoom window may overlap the selected screen area when you release the right mouse
 button.&nbsp; When this occurs, the magnifier captures the image of the resize window, not the original screen area.&nbsp;
 This only happens if the screen area you are selecting is close to the Zoom window.
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Begin_Zoom_Item"> The Begin Zoom Item </h3>
<br>The Begin Zoom item in the File menu allows you to scan the screen area without holding down the left mouse button.&nbsp;
 This is similar to the Sticky Magnifier feature that is offered in the Configure dialog.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>The Begin Zoom item is not available in Zoom for Win32.
</dl>
<br>To Zoom using the Begin Zoom item:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Select Begin Zoom from the File menu.</b>
<br>This reveals the magnifier attached to your cursor.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Position the magnifier over the screen area you want to magnify.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Resize the magnifier</b> as desired using the right mouse button.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click the left mouse button</b> to capture the selected screen area in the Zoom window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Pasting_with_Zoom"> Pasting with Zoom </h3>
<br>The paste function in Zoom allows you to paste whatever is in the Zoom window onto the clipboard.&nbsp; From here you
 can paste the clipping to other applications, such as the Image Editor.
<br><br>To paste the contents of the Zoom window to the clipboard, choose Paste to Clipboard from the File menu of the Open
 Watcom Zoom window.
<h2 id="Configuring_Zoom"> Configuring Zoom </h2>
<br>The Configure item under the File menu opens the Configure dialog.&nbsp; On this dialog you set certain options that dictate
 how the Zoom application behaves.&nbsp; Once you have selected the desired configure options, click on OK to store this information
 and close the Configure dialog.&nbsp; The following sections explain the options presented in the configure dialog.
<br><br><tt><img src="wzm2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 132.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Configure dialog, you customize the behaviour of the Zoom application.</b>
<h3 id="Configuring_Zoom__Always_On_Top"> Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; Always On Top </h3>
<br>Selecting the Always On Top option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; ensures that the Zoom window will always appear on top of other
 windows.&nbsp; If this option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; is not selected, then when working with several windows at a time the
 Zoom window can get pushed behind other windows.
<h3 id="Configuring_Zoom__Sticky_Magnifier"> Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; Sticky Magnifier </h3>
<br>Selecting Sticky Magnifier is the same as using the Begin Zoom menu item.&nbsp; When this box is checked, the zooming
 interaction Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; changes.
<br><br>The Sticky Magnifier option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; dictates that you zoom by pressing the left mouse button once
 in the Zoom window to activate the zoom function Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; and then press it once more to capture the selected
 screen area.&nbsp; With this option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; you are able to drag the magnifier into position Configuring
 Zoom:&nbsp; without holding down the mouse button.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>The Sticky Magnifier option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; is not available in the Win32 version of Zoom.
</dl>
<h3 id="Configuring_Zoom__Auto_Refresh"> Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; Auto Refresh </h3>
<br>Normally, Zoom only refreshes the selected area in the Zoom window when the magnifier moves.&nbsp; When the Auto Refresh
 option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; is selected, Zoom refreshes the image displayed in the Zoom window at regular intervals, as
 well as when the magnifier moves.&nbsp; This feature is useful when magnifying screen images that change frequently, such
 as the seconds on the clock application Configuring Zoom:.
<br><br>When the enable auto refresh box in the configuration Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; dialog is checked you can enter a value
 in the Interval field.&nbsp; This value specifies the interval in tenths of seconds that Zoom will wait between image refreshes.
<h1 id="Heap_Walker"> Heap Walker </h1>
<br><br>The Open Watcom Heap Walker is a testing and debugging tool for Windows.&nbsp; It allows you to do two things:
<ul>
<li>observe how memory is being used
<li>view the contents of memory
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Under Windows NT, the Heap Walker monitors only the memory used by 16-bit Windows applications.
</dl>
<br>Heap Walker enables you to locate corrupted data and allows you to manipulate stored memory for testing purposes.&nbsp;
 In addition to these functions, this tool allows you to optimize your memory usage.
<br><br>Heap Walker displays the stored memory, or objects, in the Heap Walker window.&nbsp; Objects are blocks of memory
 that go together to make up the global heap.&nbsp; The objects may contain information such as program instructions, data,
 or program resources.&nbsp; You control Heap Walker using the items from the menu bar.
<h2 id="Using_Heap_Walker"> Using Heap Walker </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>

<h2 id="Configuring_the_Heap_Walker_Session"> Configuring the Heap Walker Session </h2>
<br>There are many aspects of Heap Walker that you can configure, including setting the fonts, window positions, and save
 paths.&nbsp; Choose the Configure item from the File menu.&nbsp; This opens the Heap Walker Configuration dialog box where
 you customize the Heap Walker's behavior.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 134.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Heap Walker Configuration dialog, you customize the Heap Walker's behavior</b>
<br><br>The Configuration dialog is set up with defaults for all options.&nbsp; To reset all options to their defaults, click
 the Defaults button.
<h3 id="Heap_Walker__Configuring_the_File_Name_Paths"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Configuring the File Name Paths </h3>
<br>The Heap Walker window, the local heap window and the memory display windows all have file menus with save items.&nbsp;
 When you choose the save item one in these windows the currently displayed information is saved to a filename generated by
 heapwalker.
<br><br>These file names are generated based on the entries in the File name for...&nbsp; fields of the Configuration Dialog.
&nbsp; The File name for Global Saves affects filename generation for saves from the Heap Walker window.&nbsp; The File name
 for Local Saves affects filename generation for saves from the local walk window.&nbsp; The File name for Memory Dumps affects
 filename generation for saves from the memory display window.
<br><br>The file names for saves are generated from the entered file name as follows.&nbsp; If a path is specified for the
 filename then the generated file will appear in the specified directory.&nbsp; The filename for the generated file is formed
 by adding three digits to the end of the specified file name to form a new filename that is unique in the given directory.
<br><br>For example, if the File name for Memory Dumps field contains &quot;c:\mem\foo.txt&quot; then all files saved from
 the memory display window appear in the directory c:\mem and have filenames such as &quot;foo000.txt&quot;, &quot;foo001.txt&quot;
 and &quot;foo003.txt&quot;.
<br><br>Beside each file name field in the configuration dialog is a Browse button.&nbsp; Pressing this button opens a file
 selection dialog where you can view your directory structure while picking the filename for that field.
<h3 id="Heap_Walker__Configuring_Window_Behaviour"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Configuring Window Behaviour </h3>
<br>As well as file name options, the Configuration dialog contains six configuration options that you activate and de-activate
 using check boxes.&nbsp; A description of each option follows.
<h4 id="Save_Main_Window_SizeDPosition"> Save Main Window Size/Position </h4>
<br>Activating this option causes the size and position of the Heap Walker window to be saved when you close the application.
&nbsp; The next time you open the Heap Walker application, the window appears with the same size and same position as when
 you last closed it.
<h4 id="Save_Memory_Window_SizeDPosition"> Save Memory Window Size/Position </h4>
<br>Activating this option causes the size and position of the Memory Display window to be saved when you close the application.
&nbsp; The next time you open the Memory Display window, it appears with the same size and same position as when you last
 closed it.
<h4 id="Allow_Multiple_Memory_Display_Windows"> Allow Multiple Memory Display Windows </h4>
<br>When this option is activated, you can open multiple Memory Display windows.&nbsp; The new window may open on top of an
 existing window, but can be moved and resized as necessary.
<br><br>When this option is not activated, selecting a second object to view from the Heap Walker window closes the first
 Memory Display window and opens the new Memory Display window in its place.
<h4 id="Display_Memory_Info_Window"> Display Memory Info Window </h4>
<br>When this option is selected a Handle Information or Selector Information dialog box appears whenever a Memory Display
 window is opened.&nbsp; If this option is not activated the information box does not appear, but it can be opened by choosing
 Show Info from the File menu in the Memory Display window.
<h4 id="Auto_Position_Memory_Info_Window"> Auto Position Memory Info Window </h4>
<br>The setting of the Auto Position Memory Info option in the Configuration dialog determines the default setting of the
 Auto Position Info feature in the Memory Display window.
<br><br>In the Memory Display window, activating the Auto Position Info feature ensures that the information box is always
 attached to the window.&nbsp; When deactivated, the Handle Information or Selector Information dialog box moves separately
 from the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can turn on the auto position feature by selecting Auto Position Info from the
 File menu on the Memory Display window.
<h4 id="Display_Resources"> Display Resources </h4>
<br>When the Display Resources option is activated, Heap Walker displays a graphical image when you open the memory display
 window for an object that represents a graphical resource.
<h3 id="Heap_Walker__Saving_the_Current_Configuration"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Saving the Current Configuration </h3>
<br>Normally, Heap Walker saves the configuration information, such as the window size and position, only when the application
 closes.&nbsp; Choosing the Save Current Configuration item from the File menu of the Heap Walker window causes Heap Walker
 to save the current configuration information.&nbsp; This saves the main window and Memory Display window sizes and positions,
 even if the Save Main window size/position and the Save Memory window size/position options in the Configuration dialog box
 are not selected.
<h3 id="Heap_Walker__Setting_the_Font"> Heap Walker:&nbsp; Setting the Font </h3>
<br>The Font item in the File menu allows you to set the font, style, and size for the text in all Heap Walker windows.&nbsp;
 This item opens the Font dialog box.&nbsp; Select the desired font details and click on OK to close the dialog and apply
 the fonts.
<h2 id="Walking_the_Global_Heap"> Walking the Global Heap </h2>
<br>There are four lists of information you can display in the Heap Walker window.&nbsp; The Display menu allows you to choose
 a list to be displayed.&nbsp; The lists Heap Walker can display are:
<dl>
<dt>Entire Heap
<dd>All of the memory objects on the global heap
<dt><br>Free Items
<dd>All of the objects that are not currently allocated
<dt><br>LRU Items
<dd>The least recently used list items
<dt><br>Selector List
<dd>All valid selectors
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Entire_Heap"> The Entire Heap </h3>
<br>Choosing Entire Heap from the Display menu displays a list of all the global heap in the Heap Walker window.&nbsp; The
 global heap is a pool of memory set aside by the system from which all program memory is allocated.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw3.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 135.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Choosing the Entire Heap item displays the global heap.</b>
<br><br>The following are the column headings that appear when the selected display is Entire Heap, Free Items, or LRU Items.
<dl>
<dt>Handle
<dd>An identifier assigned by the operating system to each object on the global heap
<dt><br>Address
<dd>The physical address in memory of the first byte in the object
<dt><br>Size
<dd>The total number of bytes occupied by the object
<dt><br>Owner
<dd>The module that owns the memory
<dt><br>Flags
<dd>An indicator specifying the type of the object.&nbsp; The codes are F (fixed memory) and D (discardable memory).&nbsp; A blank
 indicates that Heap Walker is unable to determine if the object is fixed or discardable.
<dt><br>Lock
<dd>An identifier indicating if there is a lock on the object.&nbsp; L1 indicates there is a lock on the memory; P1 indicates
 there is a page lock on the object; a blank indicates there is no lock on the object.
<dt><br>Heap
<dd>An indicator specifying if the object has a local heap.&nbsp; The code Y indicates that the object has a local heap; a blank
 field indicates there is no local heap.
<dt><br>Type
<dd>An indicator specifying the type of information in the object
</dl>
<h3 id="Free_Items_List"> Free Items List </h3>
<br>The Free Items list contains all objects on the global heap that are currently unallocated.&nbsp; Viewing the Free Items
 list allows you to see how fragmented your free memory is.&nbsp; The Free Items list appears under the same column headings
 as The Entire Heap list.
<h3 id="LRU_Items_List"> LRU Items List </h3>
<br>The LRU Items list contains all items in the system that are currently available to be discarded.&nbsp; The system discards
 memory when there is not enough free memory to satisfy an allocation request from a program.&nbsp; Memory is discarded based
 on a least recently used algorithm.
<br><br>Only the LRU list can be sorted by age.&nbsp; When sorted this way the objects appear in order from newest to oldest.
&nbsp; This means the first object on the list will be the last item to be discarded.&nbsp; This allows you to see the order
 in which the system will discard objects.
<br><br>To sort the LRU list, refer to the section <a href="#Sorting_the_Lists">Sorting the Lists</a>.
<br><br>The LRU Items list appears under the same column headings as The Entire Heap list.
<h3 id="The_Selector_List"> The Selector List </h3>
<br>The selector list displays all valid ring three selectors in the system.&nbsp; This list also shows descriptor table information
 about each selector.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw4.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 136.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Selector List displays all valid ring three selectors.</b>
<br><br>You can view the data accessible by a selector by double clicking on its entry in the list.&nbsp; When you do this
 a Memory Display window appears.&nbsp; Attached to this window is a Selector Information dialog box that contains the information
 about the chosen selector that was displayed in the selector list.
<br><br>The following are the column headings that appear when the Selector List is displayed.
<dl>
<dt>Sel
<dd>The selector that information on this line refers to
<dt><br>Base
<dd>The lowest linear address accessible using this selector
<dt><br>Limit
<dd>The number of bytes of memory that this selector allows you to access.&nbsp; The greatest linear address accessible using
 this selector is<b> Base</b> plus the<b> Limit.</b>&nbsp; (i.e.&nbsp; &lt;sel&gt;:&lt;limit&gt;)
<dt><br>Gran
<dd>The granularity of the selector
<dt><br>Type
<dd>A value indicating if this selector provides execute access.&nbsp; This value contains the value<b> code</b> if execute access
 is provided.&nbsp; Otherwise the field contains<b> data.</b>
<dt><br>DPL
<dd>The privilege level for this selector.&nbsp; This determines the privilege level that a task requires to access this memory.
<dt><br>Access
<dd>The operations that are allowed on memory using this selector.&nbsp; The codes in this field are R (read), W (write), and
 Ex (execute).
<dt><br>Big
<dd>A code indicating if the selector's B flag (bit 54) is set.&nbsp; A<b> Y</b> in this column indicates the flag is set.&nbsp;
 A blank indicates the flag is not set.
</dl>
<h2 id="Sorting_the_Lists"> Sorting the Lists </h2>
<br>The items that appear in the Sort menu depend on the list selected from the Display menu.&nbsp; The Sort items allows
 you to organize the displayed information, making objects easier to find.&nbsp; There are two ways to sort information in
 Heap Walker.
<ul>
<li>Choose the desired sort method from the Sort menu
<br><br>or
<li>Click once on the column heading by which you want to sort.
</ul>
<br>Only those headings appearing in the Sort menu change the organization of the displayed information when selected.
<br><br>The following is a list of the headings by which you can sort the displayed information.&nbsp; Some headings have
 a secondary sort feature.&nbsp; For example, when you sort by Type, Heap Walker first sorts the Type field alphabetically,
 then organizes objects of the same Type by Owner.&nbsp; Where applicable, the secondary sort appears in parentheses.
<br><br>For the Entire Heap, Free Items, and LRU Items lists:
<ul>
<li>Address
<li>Handle
<li>Owner (secondary sort=Type)
<li>Size
<li>Type (secondary sort=Owner)
<li>Flag
<li>Age (available for LRU Items list only)
</ul>
<br>For the Selector List
<ul>
<li>Base Address
<li>Selector
<li>Limit
<li>Granularity
<li>Type
<li>DPL
</ul>
<h2 id="Viewing_the_Contents_of_Memory"> Viewing the Contents of Memory </h2>
<br>You can view the data stored in an object that appears in one of the lists displayed in the Heap Walker window by double
 clicking on the desired object.&nbsp; This opens a Memory Display window for the object.
<h3 id="The_Memory_Display_Window"> The Memory Display Window </h3>
<br><tt><img src="hw5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 137.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Memory Display window displays the data stored in the selected object.</b>
<br><br>The Memory Display window displays all of the data stored in the selected object.&nbsp; The data in this window appears
 in hexadecimal form.&nbsp; The Memory Window is useful because it allows you to see if the data in memory is what you believe
 it should be.&nbsp; Heap Walker cannot display the Memory Display window for free items or objects whose size equals zero.
<br><br>When you size the Memory Display window Heap Walker automatically reformats the information so that it is the same
 width as the window.
<br><br>Some memory objects contain information representing graphical objects used by Windows, such as menus, dialogs, cursors,
 and icons.&nbsp; When you display the data for one of these objects in the Memory Display window, Heap Walker also displays
 the object in graphical form.&nbsp; Occasionally, this operation may fail for different reasons, including lack of memory
 and the inability to read certain resource formats.
<br><br>If the object displayed is a menu then Heap Walker can tell you the constant associated with any item in the menu.
&nbsp; When the menu is displayed in graphical form simply select an item from it.&nbsp; Heap Walker will display a dialog
 that shows the name of the item selected and the numeric constant associated with it.&nbsp; This numeric constant is the
 number passed as the wparam parameter of a window's callback function when the menu item is selected.
<br><br>The Memory Display window is accompanied by an Information dialog box.&nbsp; This section describes the Information
 dialog, as well as the various functions you can perform within the Memory Display window.&nbsp; Functions include saving,
 setting the display, and setting the offset.
<h4 id="Saving_Heap_Walker_Information_to_a_File"> Saving Heap Walker Information to a File </h4>
<br>The Save items in Heap Walker allow you to save the information displayed in a window to a text file.&nbsp; Saving information
 to a file allows you to do many things, including:
<ul>
<li>print the output later
<li>compare objects outside of Heap Walker
<li>annotate the text file on-line
</ul>
<br>Choosing Save from the File menu on the Memory Display window saves the data in the window to a file name generated by
 Heap Walker based on the information in the Configuration dialog.&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which
 Heap Walker saved the file.
<br><br>Choosing Save As from the File menu allows you to specify the file to which you want to save the data currently in
 the window.&nbsp; This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.&nbsp;
 A message box appears indicating the path to which Heap Walker saved the file.
<h4 id="Changing_the_Heap_Walker_Display"> Changing the Heap Walker Display </h4>
<br>There are five ways to display the information in the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can display the information as:
<ul>
<li>Bytes
<li>Words
<li>DWords
<li>16-bit Code
<li>32-bit Code
</ul>
<br>To change the form of the displayed data, select an item from the Display menu.
<br><br>When displaying data in bytes, the data appears in the window as it physically appears in memory.&nbsp; When the data
 is displayed as words, the bytes in memory are interpreted for you so that the values displayed are those that would be obtained
 by treating the memory as an array of words.&nbsp; For example, if memory containing the values:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE FF</tt>
<br><br>was shown as words, the memory window would display:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3412 7856 BC9A FFDE</tt>
<br><br>A similar interpretation is performed when the data is displayed as DWords.&nbsp; If the above memory was shown as
 DWords, the memory window would display:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78563412 FFDEBC9A</tt>
<br><br>This rearrangement of bytes does not affect the textual interpretation of the data shown on the right hand side of
 the window.
<br><br>Selecting 16 or 32 Bit Code from the Display menu presents the data in a disassembled form.&nbsp; Sometimes presenting
 the data in disassembled form is not accurate.&nbsp; This is because when Heap Walker disassembles the data it begins at
 the first byte of the memory block and disassembles it linearly.&nbsp; If a byte in this block, such as a padding byte, throws
 off the sequence, the disassembly will be meaningless.
<h4 id="Setting_the_Offset_in_the_Memory_Display_Window"> Setting the Offset in the Memory Display Window </h4>
<br>In the Memory Display window, selecting the Set Offset item from the menu bar allows you to reposition the data so that
 the specified line appears at the top of the window.&nbsp; The offset you enter appears on the first line.&nbsp; It will
 not necessarily be the first piece of information because rounding often occurs to avoid breaking a line.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Offset</b> from the menu.
<br>This opens a Goto Offset dialog box.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw6.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 138.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Goto Offset dialog, enter the offset you want to appear at the top of
 the Memory Display window.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter the desired offset</b> that you want to position at the top of the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can enter the
 offset in decimal or hexadecimal form.&nbsp; However, you must prefix hexadecimal values with 0x (e.g.&nbsp; 0x00000005).
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>This closes the dialog and positions the data as requested.
</dl>
<h4 id="Information_Dialog_Boxes"> Information Dialog Boxes </h4>
<br>A Handle Information dialog box attached to the Memory Display window provides the information that appears on the Heap
 Walker window for the displayed object.&nbsp; The information in this dialog is:
<ul>
<li>Block Address
<li>Block Handle
<li>Block Size
<li>Lock Count
<li>Page Lock Count
</ul>
<br><tt><img src="hw7.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 139.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Handle Information dialog box displays information for the selected object.</b>
<br><br>When the selected display is the Selector List, the Selector Information dialog box is attached to the Memory Display
 window.&nbsp; The information in this dialog is:
<ul>
<li>Selector
<li>Base
<li>Limit
<li>Type
<li>DPL
<li>Granularity
<li>Access
</ul>
<br><tt><img src="hw8.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 140.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Selector Information dialog displays the Selector List information for
 the selected object.</b>
<br><br>The information boxes stay with the Memory Display window when the Auto Position Info item under the File menu is
 checked.&nbsp; Uncheck this item by selecting it again from the File menu.
<br><br>If the information dialog is not visible, reveal it by choosing Show Info from the File menu on the Memory Display
 window.&nbsp; Close this dialog by double clicking on the system menu box in the upper left hand corner of the dialog.
<h2 id="Working_with_Individual_Objects"> Working with Individual Objects </h2>
<br>The items in the Object menu enable you to operate on the individual objects on the global heap.
<dl>
<dt><b>The Object Menu</b>
<dd>
<dt><br>Show
<dd>View the data stored in an object.
<dt><br>Get Selector
<dd>Show the Selector corresponding to a Handle.
<dt><br>Discard
<dd>Request that a discardable object be purged from memory.
<dt><br>Oldest
<dd>Reposition an object to become the oldest object on the LRU list.
<dt><br>Newest
<dd>Reposition an object to become the newest object on the LRU list.
<dt><br>Add
<dd>Calculate and display the amount of memory used by selected objects.
</dl>
<br>These items allow you to quickly set up test situations while developing a program.&nbsp; For example, if you suspect
 your program has a bug caused by the system discarding a particular object, you can use the Newest item to force the system
 to keep that object.&nbsp; Similarly, you can discard an object that you suspect is causing a bug to see if your program
 runs without it.
<br><br>Some items apply only to specific objects.&nbsp; To reposition and discard objects, the selected object must be a
 discardable item.&nbsp; When the Selector List is displayed only the Show item is available.
<h3 id="Viewing_an_Object_s_Memory"> Viewing an Object's Memory </h3>
<br>Viewing an object's memory is useful because it allows you to see if what is actually in memory is what you think should
 be in memory.&nbsp; There are two ways to view an object's memory:
<ul>
<li>Double click on the desired object
<br><br>or
<li>Click once on the desired object to select it and choose Show from the Object menu.
</ul>
<br>This opens a Memory Display window for the selected object.
<br><br>You can save the information on this window to a file and change the way in which the window displays the memory information.
&nbsp; Refer to the section <a href="#Viewing_the_Contents_of_Memory">Viewing the Contents of Memory</a> for details on these
 functions.
<h3 id="Finding_a_Selector"> Finding a Selector </h3>
<br>The Get Selector function locates the selector for any object with a handle.&nbsp; You need to know the selector to get
 the logical address in memory of an object.&nbsp; This function is not available for free items or objects without handles.
<br><br>To find the selector for an object:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the object whose selector you want to find.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Get Selector</b> from the Object menu.
<br>This opens a message box which indicates the Selector that corresponds to the selected memory object.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to close the message box.
</dl>
<h3 id="Discarding_an_Object"> Discarding an Object </h3>
<br>The Discard item allows you to request that the system purge a discardable object from memory.&nbsp; Only objects marked
 by the operating system as discardable can be discarded.
<br><br>Choosing this item is equivalent to making the API call GlobalDiscard for the selected object.
<br><br>To discard an object:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the object you want to discard.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Discard</b> from the Object menu.
<br>This opens a message box which indicates the Handle of the object discarded, as well as the number of bytes discarded.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to close the message box.
</dl>
<h3 id="Repositioning_an_Object"> Repositioning an Object </h3>
<br>Repositioning objects allows you to force discardable objects to be the oldest or newest object on the LRU list.&nbsp;
 The system discards objects from memory when there is not enough free memory available to satisfy an allocation request from
 a program.&nbsp; Giving an object the status Oldest ensures that if the system discards objects from memory, this will be
 the first object discarded.&nbsp; Giving an object the status Newest ensures that when the system removes memory, this will
 be the last object removed.
<br><br>To reposition an object:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the object you want to reposition.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Oldest or Newest</b> from the Object menu, depending on how you want to reposition the object in the list.
<br>This opens a message box which indicates the handle of the object that has been repositioned in the selected manner.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to close the message box.
</dl>
<h3 id="Calculating_Memory_Size"> Calculating Memory Size </h3>
<br>The Add function is a summary function you use to calculate the memory size of selected objects.&nbsp; This function may
 be helpful in identifying memory leaks.
<br><br>A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but does not free it when the memory is no longer needed.&nbsp;
 If a program has a memory leak it requires increasingly more memory as it runs.&nbsp; With the Add function you can quickly
 determine the amount of memory being used by your program at any point in time.&nbsp; This allows you to determine if its
 memory requirements are increasing over time.
<br><br>Choosing Add from the Objects menu opens an Add dialog box.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw9.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 141.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> As you select objects, the Add function calculates and displays the number
 of selected objects and their total size.</b>
<br><br>During an Add operation the global heap list acts as an extended selection list box.&nbsp; There are several ways
 to select objects in an extended selection list box.&nbsp; The following describes three common selection techniques you
 can use.
<ul>
<li>Select one object by clicking on it.&nbsp; The Add dialog displays the size of the selected item.
<li>Select multiple objects by holding the CTRL key and clicking on each object one at a time.&nbsp; The Add dialog displays
 the number of objects selected and the total size of those objects.
<li>Select many objects in a sequence by clicking on the first object and dragging the mouse while depressing the mouse button.
&nbsp; Release the mouse button when the last item in the sequence is highlighted.&nbsp; The Add dialog displays the number
 of objects selected and the total size of those objects.
</ul>
<h2 id="Walking_the_Local_Heap"> Walking the Local Heap </h2>
<br>A local heap is a pool of memory set aside by an individual program from which only that program can make allocations.
&nbsp; Looking at the local heap allows you to see how your program is using the memory it is taking from the local heap.
<br><br>All items in the Local menu relate to objects with local heaps, so are only functional with such objects.&nbsp; Objects
 marked with a Y in the Heap column have a local heap.
<h3 id="Monitoring_Data_Segment_Usage"> Monitoring Data Segment Usage </h3>
<br>Every Windows program has a default data segment.&nbsp; This block of memory contains the program's stack, local heap
 and the memory for any static or extern variables that it declares (static data).&nbsp; If a program requires enough static
 data that its default data segment grows beyond 64K then it must be recompiled for the large memory model and may encounter
 problems when more than one instance of the program run simultaneously.
<br><br>The Monitor Local Heap item allows you to see how memory in a program's default data segment is being used so you
 can optimize this by reducing the amount of stack space allocated to the minimum required or eliminate memory leaks that
 could drive up the amount of memory required by the local heap.
<br><br>When you choose the Monitor Local Heap item a Local Heap Monitor window is opened.&nbsp; This window contains a scale
 ranging from zero to the number of bytes in the selected data segment.&nbsp; The scale is divided into colored blocks which
 illustrate how the memory for the object is used.&nbsp; Uses include:
<dl>
<dt>Fixed heap
<dd>memory occupied by fixed objects on the program's local heap
<dt><br>Free heap
<dd>memory occupied by free objects on the program's local heap
<dt><br>Moveable heap
<dd>memory occupied by movable objects on the program's local heap
<dt><br>Stack allocated
<dd>memory allocated for use by the program's stack
<dt><br>Stack used
<dd>memory actually used by the program's stack since the program began execution
<dt><br>Static data
<dd>memory used by the program's static data
<dt><br>Unknown
<dd>memory for which Heap Walker cannot determine a use
</dl>
<br>Heap Walker updates this display continuously as memory usage changes.
<br><br>To view the usage of a program's default data segment:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the object containing the default data segment</b> you want to monitor.
<br>This object will contain a local heap.&nbsp; A program's &quot;hInstance&quot; is the handle of its default data segment.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Monitor Local Heap from the Local menu.</b>
<br>The Local Heap monitor window opens which displays the usage scale for the selected object.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 142.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Local Heap Monitor window displays a scale indicating how the selected
 object is used.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Double click on the system menu</b> to close the window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Local_Walk"> Local Walk </h3>
<br>Selecting the Local Walk item from the Local menu opens the Local Heap window for the selected object.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 143.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Local Heap window displays the local heap for the selected object.</b>
<br><br>This window displays all objects on the selected object's local heap.&nbsp; Unlike the global heap, you cannot double
 click on the local heap objects to view the data they contain.
<br><br>The local heap window displays the following information:
<dl>
<dt>Offset
<dd>The number of bytes from the beginning of the object containing the local heap to the beginning of the object on the local
 heap
<dt><br>Handle
<dd>An identifier assigned by the operating system to each object on the local heap
<dt><br>Size
<dd>The total number of bytes occupied by the object
<dt><br>Flags
<dd>An indicator specifying the type of the object.&nbsp; The types are Free (unallocated object), Fixed (allocated object that
 has a fixed position on the local heap), and Moveable (allocated object that the operating system is able to reposition on
 the local heap).
<dt><br>Locks
<dd>The lock count for the object
<dt><br>Type
<dd>An indicator specifying the type of information in the object
</dl>
<br>There are two menus in this window:&nbsp; File and Sort.&nbsp; The File menu allows you to perform standard functions,
 including:
<ul>
<li>saving to a file (Save, Save As)
<li>closing the window (Exit)
</ul>
<br>Following are other functions you can perform in the Local Heap window.
<h4 id="Refresh_the_Heap"> Refresh the Heap </h4>
<br>The state of the local heap constantly changes as applications run.&nbsp; Selecting the Refresh Local List item in the
 File menu updates the information in the Local Heap window.
<h4 id="Display_Heap_Information"> Display Heap Information </h4>
<br>Selecting the Heap Info item in the File menu of the Local Heap window opens the Local Heap Information dialog box.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw12.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 144.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Local Heap Information dialog displays summary information for the current
 local heap.</b>
<br><br>This dialog displays the count and size, in bytes, of the free, moveable, and fixed objects in the local heap for
 the selected object.
<br><br>Because the state of the local heap constantly changes, you can select the Refresh button on the dialog to update
 the local heap information.&nbsp; Click on OK to close the dialog.
<h4 id="Sorting_the_Local_Heap"> Sorting the Local Heap </h4>
<br>The Sort menu allows you to select the way Heap Walker displays the local heap information, making objects easier to find.
&nbsp; There are two ways to sort information in the local heap window:
<ul>
<li>Choose the desired sort method from the Sort menu
<br><br>or
<li>Click once on the column heading by which you want to sort.
</ul>
<br>Only those headings appearing in the Sort menu change the organization of the displayed information when selected.
<h3 id="Compact_and_Local_Walk"> Compact and Local Walk </h3>
<br>Selecting the Compact and Local Walk item compacts the local heap for the selected object.&nbsp; Once compacted, this
 function opens the Local Heap window.&nbsp; The functions available on this window are the same as for the Local Walk function.
&nbsp; This function is equivalent to making the API call LocalCompact(-1) and then selecting Local Walk from the Local menu.
<h3 id="GDI_Local_Walk"> GDI Local Walk </h3>
<br>GDI is the part of the Windows operating system responsible for drawing on the screen.&nbsp; Much of what a Windows program
 does involves drawing on the screen using objects such as device contexts, pens, and bitmaps.&nbsp; GDI is responsible for
 managing these objects.&nbsp; Memory for them is contained on the GDI Local Heap.&nbsp; Walking the GDI local Heap allows
 you to view the GDI objects that currently exist in the system.
<br><br>GDI objects are a limited resource in the system, so it is important that Windows applications use them wisely.&nbsp;
 Walking the GDI Local Heap allows you to monitor GDI object usage.
<br><br>To walk the GDI Local Heap choose GDI Local Walk from the Local menu.
<h3 id="USER_Local_Walk"> USER Local Walk </h3>
<br>USER is the part of the Windows operating system responsible for managing user interface objects such as windows, menus,
 and dialogs.&nbsp; Some memory associated with these objects is contained on the USER Local Heap.
<br><br>Space on the USER Local Heap is a limited resource in the system, so it is important that Windows applications use
 it wisely.&nbsp; Walking the USER Local Heap allows you to monitor usage of this space.
<br><br>To walk the USER Local Heap choose USER Local Walk from the Local menu.
<h2 id="Working_with_the_Global_Heap"> Working with the Global Heap </h2>
<br>The global heap is a pool of memory set aside by the system from which all program memory is allocated.&nbsp; There are
 five functions you can use to monitor and manipulate the Global Heap.&nbsp; This section describes these functions.
<h3 id="Refreshing_the_Global_Heap"> Refreshing the Global Heap </h3>
<br>As programs run, the state of the global heap changes.&nbsp; When you select the global heap window after a window belonging
 to another application has been active, Heap Walker automatically refreshes the displayed global heap information.
<br><br>Selecting the Refresh Global Heap item in the Global menu forces Heap Walker to update the displayed global heap information.
<h3 id="Compacting_the_Global_Heap"> Compacting the Global Heap </h3>
<br>Compacting the global heap creates larger blocks of free memory.&nbsp; The system automatically compacts the global heap
 when it needs memory.
<br><br>The Global Compact item in the Global menu allows you to manually force the system to compact the global heap.&nbsp;
 Selecting this item is equivalent to making the API call GlobalCompact(0).
<h3 id="Removing_Discardable_Objects"> Removing Discardable Objects </h3>
<br>Selecting the Global Compact and Discard item from the Global menu removes all discardable objects and compacts the free
 memory on the global heap.&nbsp; This allows you to create larger blocks of free memory.&nbsp; Selecting this item is equivalent
 to making the API call GlobalCompact(-1).
<h3 id="Viewing_the_Global_Heap_Summary"> Viewing the Global Heap Summary </h3>
<br>Selecting the Global Heap Info item from the Global Menu opens a Global Heap Information dialog box.&nbsp; This dialog
 summarizes global heap usage.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw13.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 145.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Global Heap Information dialog provides a summary of global heap usage.</b>
<br><br>Information included on this dialog is:

<h2 id="Testing_with_Heap_Walker"> Testing with Heap Walker </h2>
<br>Heap Walker provides various allocation functions that allow you to test your programs.&nbsp; By allocating and freeing
 memory you can see how your program reacts in low memory situations.
<br><br>Each time you select the Alloc menu an Allocation Information dialog box appears on the screen.
<br><br><tt><img src="hw15.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 147.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Allocation Information dialog provides approximate size information regarding
 allocated and free memory.</b>
<br><br>The information in this dialog includes Kilobytes allocated (approximately), Kilobytes free, and Bytes free.&nbsp;
 It is important to realize that the information appearing in this dialog is approximate.&nbsp; This information appear so
 you can monitor the approximate amounts of memory you have allocated using an Allocation function.&nbsp; You should use this
 information only when using an Allocation function.
<dl>
<dt>Important:
<dd>Do not use the Allocation functions under the Windows Debug Kernel as they can make your system unstable.
</dl>
<h3 id="Allocate_All_Memory"> Allocate All Memory </h3>
<br>To see how your program runs when all free memory is allocated, choose Allocate All Memory from the Alloc menu.&nbsp;
 Choosing this item may change the appearance and performance of your application.&nbsp; This is normal because when there
 is little memory available, the system may discard fonts that Heap Walker is using and swap information to disk more frequently.
<h3 id="Free_All_Memory"> Free All Memory </h3>
<br>Selecting the Free All Memory item frees all of the allocated memory.&nbsp; This returns to the system the memory taken
 away using other Allocation functions.
<h3 id="Other_Allocation_Functions"> Other Allocation Functions </h3>
<br>The final three allocation functions-Allocate all but, Allocate, and Free-allow you to choose an amount of memory to allocate
 or free.&nbsp; Perform these functions as follows:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose the desired function</b> from the Alloc menu.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose the desired amount of memory</b> that you want to allocate, free, or leave unallocated.
<br>For all functions, an n amount is available.&nbsp; Selecting this item closes the Allocation Information dialog box and
 opens a separate dialog box displaying the following information:
<ul>
<li>K Allocated (approx.)
<li>K free (approx.)
<li>Bytes Free
</ul>
<br><tt><img src="hw16.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> In this dialog, enter the specific number of bytes to Allocate</b> all but, Allocate, or Free.
<br>The system interprets the entered value as bytes, unless you follow the value with a K, in which case the value is read
 as kilobytes.&nbsp; You can enter Hexadecimal values by prefixing them with 0x.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to process the request and close the dialog.

<h1 id="Spy"> Spy </h1>
<br>Most Windows programs are message based.&nbsp; Messages are sent to windows that programs create and the programs are
 expected to react to the messages appropriately.
<br><br>When a program does not react as expected, you must spend time debugging the program to find and correct the errors.
&nbsp; Spy is a tool designed to help you debug Windows programs by letting you view the messages sent to windows in Win16
 and Win32 applications.&nbsp; By watching how a program reacts to the messages it receives, you can isolate the parts of
 your code that are causing problems and then make the required corrections.
<br><br>With Spy:
<ul>
<li>you can determine if your window is receiving the messages you expect it to receive.
<li>you can verify that your window is receiving messages in the order you expect.
<li>novice Windows programmers can become familiar with Windows messages, by viewing the messages and their parameters.
</ul>
<br>As you run your Windows programs, Spy displays messages in the Spy window.&nbsp; You control the window using the menu
 items or the Spy toolbar.

<br><tt><img src="spy1a.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 151.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Spy toolbar.</b>
<br><br>Only one of the following three toolbar buttons appears at a time.
<dl>
<dt>NOT SPYING
<dd>This button appears when Spy is not monitoring any windows.&nbsp; Pressing this button has no effect.&nbsp; It is simply an
 indicator to you that spying is not in progress.
<dt><br>STOP SPYING TEMPORARILY
<dd>This button appears when Spy is in the process of monitoring one or more windows.&nbsp; Choosing this button temporarily suspends
 monitoring operations.&nbsp; This is equivalent to the Stop Spying Temporarily item in the Spy menu.
<dt><br>CONTINUE SPYING
<dd>This button appears when you instruct Spy to temporarily suspend monitoring operations.&nbsp; Choosing this button resumes
 monitoring operations.&nbsp; This is equivalent to the Continue Spying item in the Spy menu.
</dl>
<h2 id="The_Spy_Window"> The Spy Window </h2>
<br>The Spy window contains the menu bar and the toolbar discussed above.&nbsp; However, most of the Spy window is occupied
 by the message list.&nbsp; This is where Spy logs the messages it monitors.
<br><br><tt><img src="spy2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 152.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Once you start spying, the message list displays the messages selected for
 monitoring.</b>
<br><br>For the messages it monitors Spy displays the following information in the message list:
<dl>
<dt>Message Name
<dd>Name of the message sent.
<dt><br>hWnd
<dd>The handle of the window that received the message.
<dt><br>MsgID
<dd>The numeric identifier of the message.
<dt><br>wParam
<dd>Data specific to the message.&nbsp; This is the value that will be passed as the wparam parameter of the window's callback
 function.&nbsp; To find the meaning of this parameter see the section Viewing Message Information for information on how
 to get help on a message or refer to your Windows 3.x or Win32 programmer's documentation.
<dt><br>lParam
<dd>Data specific to the message.&nbsp; This is the value that will be passed as the lparam parameter of the window's callback
 function.&nbsp; To find the meaning of this parameter see the section Viewing Message Information for information on how
 to get help on a message or refer to your Windows 3.x or Win32 programmer's documentation.
</dl>
<br>Several spy functions affect the appearance or behavior of the Spy window.
<ul>
<li>Setting the Fonts
<li>Saving
<li>Clearing the Message List
<li>Marking the Message List
<li>Automatic Scrolling
<li>Always On Top
</ul>
<h3 id="Spy__Setting_the_Fonts"> Spy:&nbsp; Setting the Fonts </h3>
<br>The Set Font item in the File menu allows you to set the font, style, and size for the text in the Spy window.&nbsp; Choosing
 this item opens the Font dialog box.&nbsp; Select the desired font details and click on OK to close the dialog and apply
 the fonts.
<h3 id="Spy__Saving_the_Contents_of_the_Message_List"> Spy:&nbsp; Saving the Contents of the Message List </h3>
<br>The Save and Save as items under the File menu in Spy allow you to save the contents of the message list to a text file.
&nbsp; Saving information to a file enables you to print the output later or annotate the text file on-line.
<br><br>Choose Save from the File menu in the Spy window to save the message list information into the current working directory.
&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which Spy saved the file.
<br><br>Choose Save As from the File menu to specify the file to which you want to save the currently displayed information.
&nbsp; This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.&nbsp; A message
 box appears indicating the path to which Spy saved the file.
<h3 id="Spy__Clearing_the_Message_List"> Spy:&nbsp; Clearing the Message List </h3>
<br>Choose Clear from the File menu to delete all information from the message list.
<h3 id="Spy__Marking_the_Message_List"> Spy:&nbsp; Marking the Message List </h3>
<br>Use the Mark function to annotate the information in the message list by entering text into it.
<dl>
<dt>To mark the message list :
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Mark</b> from the List menu.
<br>This opens the Set Mark dialog box.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 153.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> With the Set Mark dialog, you can annotate the message list by entering text
 and choosing a mark style.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Type the desired text</b> in the Enter Mark Text field.
<br>The text you enter will appear at the end of the message list
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Select the desired Mark Style option.</b>
<br>These options determine how the entered text is formatted when it is added to the message list When the boxed option is
 selected, the text is displayed bordered by asterisks.&nbsp; With this option the text is easier to find.&nbsp; When the
 plain option is selected, the text is displayed as it is entered.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> when completed.
<br>The Set Mark dialog closes and the text in the dialog appears at the end of the message list.
</dl>
<br><tt><img src="drw3.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 154.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Text you enter in the Set Mark dialog appears in the message list in the selected
 style.</b>
<h3 id="Spy__Automatic_Scrolling"> Spy:&nbsp; Automatic Scrolling </h3>
<br>As Spy writes new information to the message list, the information is added to the bottom of the list.&nbsp; Choosing
 Auto Scroll Message List from the List menu tells Spy to automatically scroll the information in the message list so that
 the most recent information written to the message list always appears on the screen.&nbsp; The Auto Scroll Message List
 menu item is checked when this feature is active.
<br><br>When this feature is deactivated, new messages written to the message list are added to the bottom of the list and
 you must use the scroll bar to scroll down and view the information.
<h3 id="Spy__Always_On_Top"> Spy:&nbsp; Always On Top </h3>
<br>The Spy window behaves like all other windows-it moves into the background when other windows are selected.&nbsp; To ensure
 the Spy window is visible at all times, select the Always On Top item from the File menu.&nbsp; The Always On Top menu item
 is checked when this feature is enabled.&nbsp; To turn this feature off, select the item again from the File menu.
<h2 id="Selecting_Messages_to_Monitor"> Selecting Messages to Monitor </h2>
<br>Each window receives an overwhelming volume of messages.&nbsp; Generally, you will only be interested in a small subset
 of these.&nbsp; Spy lets you limit the messages on which it will report so that you do not have to sort through all the extraneous
 data yourself.
<br><br>Spy maintains two lists of messages:&nbsp; the messages to watch list and the messages to stop on list.&nbsp; When
 spy monitors a message in the messages to watch list it adds information about that message to the Message List in the Spy
 window.&nbsp; When spy monitors a message in the messages to stop on list it displays a message box reporting that the message
 has been encountered and pauses spying operations until you restart them by selecting Continue Spying from the spy menu.
&nbsp; Any message that does not appear on either list is ignored by Spy
<br><br>To modify the messages to watch list choose Messages To Watch from the Messages menu.&nbsp; To modify the messages
 to stop on list choose Messages To Stop On from the Messages menu.&nbsp; In either case, the process of modifying the list
 is the same.&nbsp; The rest of this section explains the dialogs you use to do this.
<h3 id="Selecting_Individual_Messages"> Selecting Individual Messages </h3>
<br>The most precise way to modify the messages to watch or messages to stop on lists is simply to select a set of individual
 messages to appear on the list.&nbsp; To select a set of individual messages to monitor follow these procedures.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Messages To Watch or Messages To Stop On</b> from the Messages Menu.
<br>This opens a Message Class dialog box.&nbsp; The caption of the dialog box reflects the menu item selected.
<br><br><tt><img src="spy5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 155.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Message Class dialog, select the Individual Message Control button.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Click on the Individual Message Control button.</b>
<br>This opens a dialog that contains a check box for each message.
<br><br><tt><img src="spy6.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 156.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Message Range dialog, you select the individual messages you want Spy
 to watch or stop on.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Add or remove messages from the list of messages.</b>
<br>A message appears on the selected list if it is checked.&nbsp; The following buttons are provided for your convenience:
<dl>
<dt>Clear All
<dd>Uncheck all messages on this dialog.
<dt><br>Set All
<dd>Check all messages on this dialog.
</dl>
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Choose an action button.</b>
<br>The following buttons allow you to proceed from this dialog:
<dl>
<dt>Next
<dd>Close the current dialog and open the one for the alphabetic range of messages immediately following this one.&nbsp; Changes
 made on the current dialog will not be saved until you press the OK button on some future message range dialog.
<dt><br>Prev
<dd>Close the current dialog and open the one for the alphabetic range of messages immediately preceding this one.&nbsp; Changes
 made on the current dialog will not be saved until you press the OK button on some future message range dialog.
<dt><br>OK
<dd>Close the current dialog and save all changes made in it and in previous dialog that were exited using the Next or Prev button.
<dt><br>Cancel
<dd>Close the current dialog and ignore all changes made in it and in previous dialog that were exited using the Next or Prev
 button.
</dl>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Select OK on the Message Class dialog.</b>
<br>The message class dialog closes and your message selections take effect.&nbsp; If you choose Cancel on the Message Class
 dialog your message selections will be discarded.
</dl>
<h3 id="Selecting_Message_Classes"> Selecting Message Classes </h3>
<br>Although modifying the list of messages to watch or stop on by selecting individual messages is more precise, you may
 find this process tedious.&nbsp; To speed up the process several message classes have been defined for you.&nbsp; These classes
 group messages by their function.&nbsp; The messages contained in each message class are listed in the section entitled <a href="#Predefined_Spy_Message_Classes">Predefined Spy Message Classes</a>
<br><br>Selecting a message class adds all the individual messages in that class to the selected list.&nbsp; Similarly, de-selecting
 a message class removes all the individual messages in that class from the selected list.
<br><br>To select messages to monitor by class follow these procedures:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Messages To Watch or Messages To Stop On</b> from the Messages Menu.
<br>This opens a Message Class dialog box.&nbsp; The caption of the dialog box reflects the menu item selected.&nbsp; 
<br><br><tt><img src="spy5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 157.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Message class dialog, choose the message classes you want Spy to monitor.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Click on the check box</b> beside the message classes you want to monitor.
<br>A message class is selected when an X appears in the check box.&nbsp; The following buttons are available for your convenience:
<dl>
<dt>Clear All
<dd>De-select all of the message classes.
<dt><br>Set All
<dd>Select all of the message classes.
</dl>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to save your choices and close the dialog.
<br>Selecting Cancel on this dialog exits without saving your selections.
</dl>
<h3 id="Predefined_Spy_Message_Classes"> Predefined Spy Message Classes </h3>
<br>The sections that follow list the messages contained in each message class that Spy defines for you.
<br><br>Messages followed by (*) are undocumented messages.
<br><br>Messages followed by (**) are available under Win32 only.

<h3 id="Saving_and_Loading_Message_Configurations"> Saving and Loading Message Configurations </h3>
<br>Selecting messages to monitor can be an involved procedure because of the number of options available.&nbsp; Once selected,
 the group of message selections is called a message configuration.
<br><br>Spy allows you to save message configurations and recall them again.&nbsp; This section describes the functions relating
 to message configurations:
<ul>
<li>Using the Auto Save Feature
<li>Saving a Message Configuration
<li>Loading a Message Configuration
</ul>
<h4 id="Using_the_Auto_Save_Feature"> Using the Auto Save Feature </h4>
<br>When the Auto Save Message Configuration feature is active Spy saves your message configuration each time you exit.&nbsp;
 The next time you start Spy, the message configuration is automatically reloaded.
<br><br>To activate or deactivate this feature choose the Auto Save Message Configuration item from the Messages menu.&nbsp;
 When this feature is active its menu item is checked.
<h4 id="Saving_a_Message_Configuration"> Saving a Message Configuration </h4>
<br>With Spy you can save your message configurations so you can easily load a previous message configuration instead of reselecting
 the desired messages.
<br><br>To save a message configuration follow these procedures:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Select the messages you want to monitor</b> as described in the sections entitled <a href="#Selecting_Message_Classes">Selecting Message Classes</a>
 and <a href="#Selecting_Individual_Messages">Selecting Individual Messages</a>.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Save Message Configuration</b> from the Messages menu.
<br>This opens a Save As dialog box.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Specify the desired file name and path</b> for this message configuration.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> in the Save As dialog box when completed.
<br>This saves the message configuration as specified and closes the dialog.
</dl>
<h4 id="Loading_a_Message_Configuration"> Loading a Message Configuration </h4>
<br>To load a previously saved message configuration, follow these procedures:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Load Message Configuration</b> from the Messages menu.
<br>The Open dialog box appears.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select the message configuration you previously saved.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>The Open dialog box closes and Spy loads the selected message configuration.
</dl>
<h2 id="Spying"> Spying </h2>
<br>Once you have selected the messages you want Spy to monitor, you select windows for Spy to watch.&nbsp; This starts spying
 operations.
<h3 id="Start_Spying"> Start Spying </h3>
<br>Message logging begins when you select a window to monitor.&nbsp; Spy monitors the selected window for the messages specified.
&nbsp; You can start spying by selecting one window to spy on, or choosing to spy on all windows.
<dl>
<dt>To spy on all windows:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)

<br>Spy begins immediately monitoring all windows for the specified messages.&nbsp; The caption bar specifies that you are
 monitoring all windows.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>You can use the All Windows menu item at any time, not just to start spying.&nbsp; If you begin spying by choosing one window,
 then want to monitor all windows, choose All Windows from the Spy menu.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>To spy on one window:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Select Window</b> from the Spy menu.

<br>Information about the currently selected window appears in the dialog.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Position the cursor on the window you want to monitor.&nbsp; Release the mouse button.</b>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>You can select only one window at a time using the Select Window dialog box.
</dl>
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to save this window selection.
<br>This closes the Select Window dialog and opens the Spy window.&nbsp; The window heading specifies that you are monitoring
 multiple windows.
</dl>
<h3 id="Stop_Spying"> Stop Spying </h3>
<br>Choose Done Spying from the Spy menu to stop spying on the selected windows.&nbsp; When you choose this item, Spy does
 not retain the list of windows selected for spying.
<h3 id="Pause_Spying"> Pause Spying </h3>
<br>Choose Stop Spying Temporarily from the Spy menu to pause message logging.&nbsp; When you choose this item, Spy retains
 the list of windows selected for spying.
<br><br>The Stop Spying Temporarily menu item changes to Continue Spying when the pause is active.&nbsp; Choose Continue Spying
 from the Spy menu to start spying again.&nbsp; This starts spying and changes the menu item back to Stop Spying Temporarily.
<h2 id="Viewing_Message_Information"> Viewing Message Information </h2>
<br>Double clicking on a message in the message list reveals a Message Information dialog box which contains additional information
 about the selected message.&nbsp; This dialog displays the message, the number of times it has been issued, and the window
 that received the selected instance of the message.
<br><br><tt><img src="spy9.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 159.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Message Information dialog box displays additional information about the
 selected message.</b>
<br><br>From the Message Information dialog you can perform the following actions:
<ul>
<li>Reset the usage count
<li>Display Windows help for the message.
<li>Change the monitoring state for the message.
<li>Highlight the window that received the message.
<li>Display information about the window that received the message.
</ul>
<h3 id="Resetting_the_Usage_Count"> Resetting the Usage Count </h3>
<br>You can reset the usage count for the message to zero by pressing the Reset Count button on the Message Information dialog.
&nbsp; The usage count will also be automatically reset to zero when you start spying or clear the message list.
<h3 id="Displaying_Help_for_the_Message"> Displaying Help for the Message </h3>
<br>You can get more information about most messages, such as the meaning of their parameters, by the Help for Message button
 on the Message Information dialog.&nbsp; This starts the Windows help facility to display the information.&nbsp; Help is
 not available for all messages.
<h3 id="Changing_the_Monitoring_State_of_the_Message"> Changing the Monitoring State of the Message </h3>
<br>The watch and stop on check boxes in the Message Information dialog indicate if the message appears in the messages to
 watch or messages to stop on lists.&nbsp; You can add the message to either of these lists by checking the appropriate check
 box or remove it by removing the check.
<h3 id="Highlighting_the_Receiving_Window"> Highlighting the Receiving Window </h3>
<br>If the window that received this message has not been destroyed you can highlight it by selecting the Highlight Window
 button.&nbsp; This changes the border color of the window so it is easy to locate.
<h3 id="Displaying_Information_about_the_Receiving_Window"> Displaying Information about the Receiving Window </h3>
<br>If the window that received this message has not been destroyed you can get additional information about it by selecting
 the Show Information button.&nbsp; This opens a Window Information dialog that displays information such as the window's
 class, style, size and position.&nbsp; For more information on the Window Information dialog see the section entitled <a href="#Viewing_Window_Information">Viewing Window Information</a>.
<h2 id="Spy__Working_with_Log_Files"> Spy:&nbsp; Working with Log Files </h2>
<br>By writing the information in the message list to a log file, you have a file you can look at in case a program you are
 running terminates your applications.&nbsp; In such a situation, your message list is lost so you have no information to
 refer to when debugging.&nbsp; Writing to a log file also allows you to print the output later or annotate the text file
 on-line.
<h3 id="Spy__Configuring_the_Log_File"> Spy:&nbsp; Configuring the Log File </h3>
<br>Choosing Configure Log from the File menu opens the Log Configuration dialog where you customize Spy's behaviour when
 it logs to a file.&nbsp; This dialog contains four sections where you specify information.
<br><br><tt><img src="spy10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 160.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Log Configuration dialog you set the desired behaviour for Spy when
 logging to a file.</b>
<h4 id="Spy__Default_Log_Name"> Spy:&nbsp; Default Log Name </h4>
<br>In the Default Log Name field, specify the file to which Spy writes when you begin logging.&nbsp; Clicking the Browse
 button next to this field opens a Choose Log Name dialog that lets you browse your file structure while choosing the log
 name.
<h4 id="Spy__Log_Name"> Spy:&nbsp; Log Name </h4>
<br>The settings in the Log Name section of the dialog indicate to Spy how the name of the log file should be determined when
 the Log to File menu item is chosen.
<br><br>When the Query for Log Name option is selected, Spy presents a prompt each time you select Log to File from the File
 menu or the toolbar.&nbsp; This reveals a Choose Log Name dialog where you specify the file to which Spy writes the log information.
<br><br>When the Use Default Log Name option is selected, Spy writes the log information to the file indicated in the Default
 Log Name field in the Log Configuration dialog.&nbsp; No prompt appears.
<h4 id="Spy__Action_When_Log_File_Exists"> Spy:&nbsp; Action When Log File Exists </h4>
<br>The options in the Action When Log File Exists section of the Log Configuration dialog dictate how Spy behaves when you
 choose Log to File and a log file already exists.
<dl>
<dt>Replace
<dd>Spy writes over the existing log file.&nbsp; All information in the existing file is lost.
<dt><br>Append
<dd>Spy adds the new information to the end of the existing log file.
<dt><br>Query
<dd>Spy prompts you with a message box that allows you to choose a course of action-Replace, Append, or Cancel.
</dl>
<br><tt><img src="spy11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 161.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Log Information message box appears when logging if the Query option is
 selected on the Log Configuration dialog.</b>
<h3 id="Spy__Start_Logging"> Spy:&nbsp; Start Logging </h3>
<br>Choosing Log to File from the File menu tells Spy to write all new information added to the message list to the log file.
&nbsp; Depending on the options selected in the Log Configuration dialog, the following dialogs may appear when you choose
 Log to File:
<ul>
<li>Choose Log Name dialog-On this dialog you specify the file to which Spy writes the log information.
<li>Log Information dialog-On this dialog you choose a course of action for logging when the specified log file already exists.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Choosing Cancel on either of these dialogs closes the dialog and prevents logging from starting.
</dl>
<h3 id="Spy__Logging_Type"> Spy:&nbsp; Logging Type </h3>
<br>There are two ways to write information to the log file:&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>Continuous Logging
<li>Periodic Logging
</ul>
<br>If the Continuous Logging option is activated, then as Spy writes information to the message list, it simultaneously writes
 to a log file.
<br><br>When the Periodic Logging option is activated, Spy writes information to the log file only after a reasonable amount
 of information, as determined by the application, has been recorded in the message list
<br><br>Periodic logging is more convenient because it is faster than continuous logging.&nbsp; However, if your system goes
 down, some information will be lost.&nbsp; By simultaneously writing to the log file and the message list, continuous logging
 allows you to store all information in a log file without the chance of losing information.
<h3 id="Spy__Stop_Logging"> Spy:&nbsp; Stop Logging </h3>
<br>Once the log is started, Spy continues writing to the log file until you stop logging.&nbsp; A check mark beside the Log
 to File item in the File menu indicates that a log is being created.&nbsp; Choose this item again to stop logging.
<h3 id="Spy__Pause_Logging"> Spy:&nbsp; Pause Logging </h3>
<br>To temporarily stop writing information to the log file you can choose the Pause Log item from the File menu.&nbsp; A
 check mark appears beside the item indicating that the log is currently paused.&nbsp; To restart logging, choose this item
 again from the File menu.
<h2 id="Viewing_Window_Information"> Viewing Window Information </h2>
<br>In Spy you can view different window information using items in the Spy menu.&nbsp; You can view:
<ul>
<li>information about a specific window
<li>a list of all windows open on your desktop
</ul>
<h3 id="Viewing_Information_About_a_Window"> Viewing Information About a Window </h3>
<br>To view information about a window:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Peek At Window</b> from the Spy menu.
<br>This minimizes the Spy window and opens the Peek At Window dialog box.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Position the cursor inside the icon in the dialog box.&nbsp; Press the mouse button and hold it down.</b>
<br>As you move the cursor across the screen, the window on which the cursor is positioned has a highlighted border and information
 about the selected window appears in the dialog box.&nbsp; The following information is displayed:

<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Pausing_the_Event_List_Output"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Pausing the Event List Output </h3>
<br>The Output to Screen item in the Output menu allows you to temporarily stop writing information to the event list.&nbsp;
 When this menu item is unchecked output will not be written to the event list.&nbsp; Although DDE Spy stops writing information
 to the event list, it still writes it to the log file if you are currently creating a log file.&nbsp; When DDE Spy is not
 writing information to the event list applications will run sightly faster so when you are not interested in viewing the
 event list you may want to stop writing to it.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If you mark the event list while the Output to Screen feature is deactivated, the text you enter does not appear in the event
 list.
</dl>
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Automatic_Scrolling"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Automatic Scrolling </h3>
<br>As DDE Spy writes new information to the event list, the information is added to the bottom of the list.&nbsp; Checking
 the Auto Scroll item in the Output menu tells DDE Spy to automatically scroll the information in the event list so that the
 most recent information written to the event list always appears on the screen.
<br><br>When the Auto Scroll menu item not checked you must use the scroll bar to scroll down and view any new information
 that is added to the event list.
<h2 id="Selecting_Information_to_Monitor"> Selecting Information to Monitor </h2>
<br>The monitor menu contains items that let you specify the types of DDE events that DDE Spy will report on by recording
 them in the event list.&nbsp; Limiting the amount of information logged makes reading the event list more efficient.
<br><br>When an item appears in the menu with a checkmark, DDE Spy reports on that type of activity.&nbsp; The following describes
 various types of activity DDE Spy can monitor.
<dl>
<dt>Posted Messages
<dd>When the Posted Messages item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list whenever a DDE message that has been selected
 using the Message Filter dialog is posted to an application's message queue.
<dt><br>Sent Messages
<dd>When the Sent Messages item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list whenever a DDE message that has been selected
 using the Message Filter dialog is sent to an application.
<dt><br>String Handle Data
<dd>DDE applications use strings to communicate with other applications.&nbsp; These strings are registered with the operating
 system by the applications using them.&nbsp; When done with the strings, the applications tell the operating system they
 are done and the system destroys the strings.&nbsp; DDE Spy reports on all string operations that occur within the system
 when the String Handle Data menu item is checked.
<dt><br>Callbacks
<dd>Callbacks are special functions called by the operating system to process DDE messages.&nbsp; When the Callback item is checked
 DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list each time the operating system calls a DDE Callback for a transaction type that
 has been selected using the Callback Filter dialog.
<dt><br>Errors
<dd>A DDE error usually indicates that a DDE operation has failed.&nbsp; When the Errors item is checked, DDE Spy reports all
 DDE errors that occur within the system.
<dt><br>Conversations
<dd>A conversation is the connection established between two applications that is necessary to perform DDE operations.&nbsp; When
 the Conversations item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list each time a conversation is established or terminated.
<dt><br>Links
<dd>A link is a relationship between two DDE applications:&nbsp; a server and a client.&nbsp; A link is established for a single
 value maintained by the server.&nbsp; When this value changes the server notifies the client.&nbsp; When the Links item is
 checked, DDE Spy logs notifications in the event list each time a link is established or terminated.
</dl>
<h3 id="Setting_the_Message_Filter"> Setting the Message Filter </h3>
<br>The Set Message Filter item opens the Message Filter dialog which lists the various DDE messages that can be posted or
 sent.&nbsp; This dialog allows you to select the specific messages you want DDE Spy to write to the event list.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 169.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Set Message Filter dialog, select the messages on which you want DDE

<li>Use the Clear All button in this dialog to deactivate all of the transaction types.
</ul>
<br>Click on OK when the desired transaction types are activated.
<h2 id="DDE_Spy__Working_with_Log_Files"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Working with Log Files </h2>
<br>By writing the information in the event list to a log file, you have a file you can look at in case a program you are
 running terminates your applications.&nbsp; In such a situation, your event list is lost so you have no information to refer
 to when debugging.&nbsp; Writing to a log file also allows you to print the output later or annotate the text file on-line.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Configuring_the_Log_File"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Configuring the Log File </h3>
<br>Choosing Configure Log from the File menu opens the Log Configuration dialog where you customize DDE Spy's behaviour when
 it logs to a file.&nbsp; This dialog contains four sections where you specify information.
<br><br><tt><img src="spy10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 171.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Log Configuration dialog you set the desired behaviour for DDE Spy when
 logging to a file.</b>
<h4 id="DDE_Spy__Default_Log_Name"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Default Log Name </h4>
<br>In the Default Log Name field, specify the file to which DDE Spy writes when you begin logging.&nbsp; Clicking the Browse
 button next to this field opens a Choose Log Name dialog that lets you browse your file structure while choosing the log
 name.
<h4 id="DDE_Spy__Log_Name"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Log Name </h4>
<br>The settings in the Log Name section of the dialog indicate to DDE Spy how the name of the log file should be determined
 when the Log to File menu item is chosen.
<br><br>When the Query for Log Name option is selected, DDE Spy presents a prompt each time you select Log to File from the
 File menu or the toolbar.&nbsp; This reveals a Choose Log Name dialog where you specify the file to which DDE Spy writes
 the log information.
<br><br>When the Use Default Log Name option is selected, DDE Spy writes the log information to the file indicated in the
 Default Log Name field in the Log Configuration dialog.&nbsp; No prompt appears.
<h4 id="DDE_Spy__Action_When_Log_File_Exists"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Action When Log File Exists </h4>
<br>The options in the Action When Log File Exists section of the Log Configuration dialog dictate how DDE Spy behaves when
 you choose Log to File and a log file already exists.
<dl>
<dt>Replace
<dd>DDE Spy writes over the existing log file.&nbsp; All information in the existing file is lost.
<dt><br>Append
<dd>DDE Spy adds the new information to the end of the existing log file.
<dt><br>Query
<dd>DDE Spy prompts you with a message box that allows you to choose a course of action-Replace, Append, or Cancel.
</dl>
<br><tt><img src="spy11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 172.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Log Information message box appears when logging if the Query option is
 selected on the Log Configuration dialog.</b>
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Start_Logging"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Start Logging </h3>
<br>Choosing Log to File from the File menu tells DDE Spy to write all new information added to the event list to the log
 file.&nbsp; Depending on the options selected in the Log Configuration dialog, the following dialogs may appear when you
 choose Log to File:
<ul>
<li>Choose Log Name dialog-On this dialog you specify the file to which DDE Spy writes the log information.
<li>Log Information dialog-On this dialog you choose a course of action for logging when the specified log file already exists.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Choosing Cancel on either of these dialogs closes the dialog and prevents logging from starting.
</dl>
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Logging_Type"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Logging Type </h3>
<br>There are two ways to write information to the log file:&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>Continuous Logging
<li>Periodic Logging
</ul>
<br>If the Continuous Logging option is activated, then as DDE Spy writes information to the event list, it simultaneously
 writes to a log file.
<br><br>When the Periodic Logging option is activated, DDE Spy writes information to the log file only after a reasonable
 amount of information, as determined by the application, has been recorded in the event list
<br><br>Periodic logging is more convenient because it is faster than continuous logging.&nbsp; However, if your system goes
 down, some information will be lost.&nbsp; By simultaneously writing to the log file and the message list, continuous logging
 allows you to store all information in a log file without the chance of losing information.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Stop_Logging"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Stop Logging </h3>
<br>Once the log is started, DDE Spy continues writing to the log file until you stop logging.&nbsp; A check mark beside the
 Log to File item in the File menu indicates that a log is being created.&nbsp; Choose this item again to stop logging.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Pause_Logging"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Pause Logging </h3>
<br>To temporarily stop writing information to the log file you can choose the Pause Log item from the File menu.&nbsp; A
 check mark appears beside the item indicating that the log is currently paused.&nbsp; To restart logging, choose this item
 again from the File menu.
<h2 id="Tracking_with_DDE_Spy"> Tracking with DDE Spy </h2>
<br>In the process of DDE interactions programs register and unregister several types of DDE objects such as:
<ul>
<li>Strings
<li>Conversations
<li>Links
<li>Servers
</ul>
<br>The tracking windows offer you an easy way to determine at any time which objects are currently registered with the system.
<br><br>To open a tracking window choose Strings, Conversations, Links or Servers from the Track menu.&nbsp; This opens a
 tracking window that displays all the objects of the selected type that have been registered but not unregistered since DDE
 Spy started.&nbsp; The tracking windows are automatically updated whenever an event occurs that changes the displayed information.
<br><br>Each tracking window lists its information in tabular form under several headings.&nbsp; You can sort the displayed
 information based on any column by clicking on the column heading for that column.
<h3 id="Tracking_Strings"> Tracking Strings </h3>
<br>Choose Strings from the Track menu to open a Strings window which tracks all strings currently registered with the operating
 system.&nbsp; As strings are destroyed, DDE Spy removes them from the list.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde9.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 173.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Strings window tracks all strings currently registered with the operating

<dt>Server Name
<dd>The name of each server that is registered with the operating system.&nbsp; This name is generally descriptive of the type
 of server.
<dt><br>Instance Name
<dd>The server name with a numeric identifier added by the operating system.&nbsp; This name uniquely identifies the server in
 the system.
</dl>
<h2 id="Working_with_Aliases"> Working with Aliases </h2>
<br>The event list displays an overwhelming array of numeric identifiers.&nbsp; The alias functions allow you to replace these
 numeric identifiers with meaningful text.&nbsp; This makes the event list easier for you to understand.&nbsp; For example,
 if you are monitoring a server application and you know it's task id is 0x1234 then you can replace every occurrence of that
 task id with the text &quot;server&quot;.
<h3 id="Defining_Aliases"> Defining Aliases </h3>
<br>Using the alias functions you can define aliases for window handles, task id's and conversation id's.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Add hwnd alias, Add task alias or Add conversation alias</b> from the Alias menu
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Click on the appropriate icon on the toolbar.</b>
<br>This opens the appropriate Add Alias dialog.&nbsp; The dialog contains a list box that lists all identifiers of the chosen

<br>This allows you to create aliases for more numeric identifiers.
</dl>
<h3 id="Disabling_Aliases"> Disabling Aliases </h3>
<br>Choosing Disable Aliases from the Aliases menu changes all aliased values back to their original numeric identifiers.
&nbsp; The Disable Aliases menu item is checked when this option is active.&nbsp; Choosing the menu item again disables it.
&nbsp; Numeric identifiers are then replaced by their text aliases again.
<h3 id="Purging_Aliases"> Purging Aliases </h3>
<br>Choosing Purge Aliases from the Aliases menu deletes all aliases set up in DDE Spy.&nbsp; Any values replaced by aliases
 will revert to their original numeric values.
<h1 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom_for_Windows_3_1"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom for Windows 3.1 </h1>
<br><br>The 16-bit version of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is a post-mortem debugger for Windows 3.1.&nbsp; When an exception occurs in
 a program, a post-mortem debugger allows you, after the fact, to examine the state of both the program and the system in
 order to determine the cause of the exception.&nbsp; In addition to being a debugging tool, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is a system
 utility that enables you to examine task information.
<br><br>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can be a useful tool when performing in-house testing on your applications.&nbsp; By running Dr.
&nbsp; Watcom while testing applications, all faults are logged.&nbsp; This gives you important information to recreate the
 errors so you can fix the problems.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Use the 16-bit version of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to monitor 16-bit Windows (Win16) applications running under Windows 3.1 or Win32
 based operating systems.&nbsp; Use the 32-bit version of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to monitor Win32 applications running under Win32
 based operating systems.
</dl>
<h2 id="Win16__Using_Dr__Watcom"> Win16:&nbsp; Using Dr.&nbsp; Watcom </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Starting Dr.&nbsp; Watcom
<li>Quitting Dr.&nbsp; Watcom
<li>The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom Menu Bar
</ul>
<br>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is designed to be used effectively while minimized.&nbsp; You only need to view the application window
 when an error or warning occurs.&nbsp; When this happens the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon changes from stethoscope to an explosion
 indicating that information is waiting for your attention in the main window.
<br><br>Some of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom's main functionality can also be accessed using the system menu while the application is
 minimized.&nbsp; This includes the log options, task control, and log current state functions.
<br><br>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is more useful with the Windows debug kernel.&nbsp; Under the debug kernel, Windows checks for many
 common programming errors and generates debugging messages when it finds them.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom catches the debugging
 messages and displays them on the event list.&nbsp; Viewing these messages helps you identify errors in your program that
 you might not otherwise see.
<h3 id="Win16__Starting_Dr__Watcom"> Win16:&nbsp; Starting Dr.&nbsp; Watcom </h3>
<br>To start Dr.&nbsp; Watcom, double click on the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon.&nbsp; This opens the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom window.
<h3 id="Win16__Quitting_Dr__Watcom"> Win16:&nbsp; Quitting Dr.&nbsp; Watcom </h3>
<br>To exit Dr.&nbsp; Watcom, select Exit from the File menu.&nbsp; This is the only way to quit the application.&nbsp; Unlike
 other applications, double clicking on the system menu box or selecting close from the system menu only minimizes the application.
<h3 id="Win16__The_Dr__Watcom_Menu_Bar"> Win16:&nbsp; The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom Menu Bar </h3>
<br>The menu bar consists of the following four menus:

<h2 id="Win16__Using_the_Dr__Watcom_Window"> Win16:&nbsp; Using the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom Window </h2>
<br>When you open Dr.&nbsp; Watcom, a window appears which contains the event list.&nbsp; The event list records the various
 events occurring under Windows.&nbsp; Some examples of events are errors, debugging messages (under the debug kernel of Windows
 only), the starting and ending of programs, and the loading and unloading of DLLs.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw1.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 178.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom window contains the event list which records and displays
 events occurring under Windows.</b>
<br><br>When a debug message is issued, the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon alerts you that an entry has been made on the event list.
&nbsp; The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon changes from stethoscope to an explosion.&nbsp; To reset the icon you must acknowledge the
 alert in one of two ways:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> View the event list</b> by double clicking on the icon, or
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Clear Alert</b> from the system menu.
</dl>
<br>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom intercepts all exceptions that occur in the system.&nbsp; An exception is an error that causes your program
 to terminate.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom prevents your program from terminating by halting the program's execution.&nbsp; The
 state of the program remains intact.
<br><br>As with non-fatal errors, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom makes an entry on the event list when an exception occurs.&nbsp; However,
 instead of alerting you to the entry by changing the icon, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom reveals an exception dialog.&nbsp; This dialog
 gives you several options.&nbsp; Refer to the section entitled <a href="#Win16__Dr__Watcom__Exception_Handling">Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Exception Handling</a>

&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can only read a given type of debugging information if it has successfully loaded the appropriate
 DIP.
<h3 id="Win16__Using_the_Clear_Alert_Function"> Win16:&nbsp; Using the Clear Alert Function </h3>
<br>If you are running Dr.&nbsp; Watcom minimized then each time an error or warning is logged, the icon changes from a stethoscope
 to an explosion.&nbsp; Unless you reset the icon, you will not know when more events are added to the event list.
<br><br>There are two ways to reset the Dr.&nbsp; Watcom icon:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Double click on the icon</b> to view the event list, or
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Clear Alert</b> from the system menu.

<h2 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Exception_Handling"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Exception Handling </h2>
<br>The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom exception dialog box appears on your screen when an exception occurs in any program in the system.
&nbsp; This indicates that a fatal error has occurred.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 182.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The exception dialog appears when a fatal error occurs in a program.</b>
<br><br>Instead of terminating the program, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom suspends it and leaves its state intact.&nbsp; Because the state
 is undisturbed you can view the program's state information from the exception dialog, including memory and register values.
&nbsp; The exception dialog displays information about error and gives you several options.&nbsp; The information displayed
 about the error includes:
<dl>
<dt>Task Name
<dd>The name of the module in which the error occurred.
<dt><br>Task Path
<dd>The full path of the file from which the offending module was loaded.
<dt><br>Fault Type
<dd>The type of fault that occurred.
<dt><br>Fault CS:EIP
<dd>The address of the instruction being executed when the fault occurred.
<dt><br>Source Info
<dd>The source line on which the error occurred.&nbsp; This only appears if the program running contains debugging information.
</dl>
<br>There are four buttons on the exception dialog that you can use to proceed.
<dl>
<dt>Act
<dd>When the act button is pressed, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom's action is determined by the option currently selected in the action to
 take section of the dialog.&nbsp; The following describes the action taken for each option.
<dl>
<dt>Terminate Task
<dd>When the Terminate Task radio button is selected choosing Act causes the faulting task to be terminated immediately.
<dt><br>Restart Instruction
<dd>When the Restart Instruction radio button is selected choosing Act causes the faulting task to restart execution starting
 with the instruction pointed to by its CS:EIP.&nbsp; This option is primarily used to restart a task after you have changed
 its register values using the Task Status dialog.
<dt><br>Chain to Next Handler
<dd>A handler is a piece of code, a program, or a routine that gets called when an exception occurs.&nbsp; The system can have
 several exception handlers.&nbsp; When the Chain to Next Handler radio button is selected choosing Act passes the exception
 on to the next handler in the sequence, or chain.
</dl>
<dt><br>Act and Log
<dd>Choosing the Act and Log button first creates a log file entry recording information about this fault then takes the same
 action that would result from choosing the Act button.
<dt><br>Registers
<dd>Select the Registers button to open the Task Status dialog.&nbsp; This dialog gives you additional information on the state
 of the program when it crashed.&nbsp; From this window you can change the registers and flags, view segment mappings, and
 do a stack trace.&nbsp; Refer to the section entitled <a href="#Win16__Examining_the_Task_Status">Win16:&nbsp; Examining the Task Status</a>
 for further information.
<dt><br>Options
<dd>Select the Options button to choose the information you want to write to the log file.&nbsp; This opens the Log File Options

</dl>
<h3 id="Win16__Examining_the_Task_Status"> Win16:&nbsp; Examining the Task Status </h3>
<br>The Task Status dialog appears when you choose the Registers button on the exception dialog.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw6.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 183.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Task Status dialog provides additional information on the program state
 when the exception occurred.</b>
<br><br>This dialog displays information in four sections:
<ul>
<li>Source Information
<li>Registers
<li>Flags
<li>Instructions Around Fault
</ul>
<br>The Source Information section indicates the source file where the error occurred and the line of that source file.&nbsp;
 In order to get source information, your program must have debugging information.&nbsp; N/A appears in the Source Information
 section if the program does not contain debugging information or the exception occurred on an assembly instruction that does
 not correspond to a source file.
<br><br>The Registers and Flags sections display information in the CPU at the time of the exception.
<br><br>The Instructions Around Fault section displays the assembly instructions surrounding the instruction that was being
 executed when the fault occurred.&nbsp; An asterisk marks the instruction to which the CS:EIP is currently pointing.
<br><br>When the Show Symbols box is checked, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom tries to replace addresses in the assembly code with symbolic
 names.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can only replace addresses if the faulting module contained debugging information.&nbsp; If
 this box is not checked, addresses are left as numeric values.
<h4 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Changing_the_Registers"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Changing the Registers </h4>
<br>In the Task Status dialog you can set up testing and debugging situations by changing the register and flag values.&nbsp;
 To change a register value simply enter a new value in the edit field that contains the current register value.&nbsp; To
 change the state of a flag register just check or uncheck the check box associated with that flag.&nbsp; A flag has a value
 of 1 when its check box is checked.
<br><br>The register and flag values will not take effect until you choose OK on the Task Status dialog.
<h4 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Applying_Registers"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Applying Registers </h4>
<br>Choosing Apply Registers updates the information in the Task Status dialog based on values of registers and flags to which
 you have made changes.
<h4 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Segment_Mapping"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Segment Mapping </h4>
<br>Choosing Segment Map from the Task Status dialog opens a Segment Map dialog box which indicates the selectors to which
 your map segments were mapped.&nbsp; There is one entry for every segment in the program.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw7.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 184.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Segment Map dialog lists the selectors to which the segments were mapped.</b>
<br><br>This dialog allows you to view the data contained in each of your program's segments.&nbsp; To view this memory, double
 click on the desired segment.&nbsp; This opens a Memory Display window for the selected segment.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw8.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 185.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Memory Display window displays the memory stored in the selected segment.</b>
<br><br>The Memory Display window displays all of the data stored in the selected segment.&nbsp; This information appears
 in hexadecimal form.&nbsp; This allows you to see if the data in memory is what you believe it should be.
<br><br>There are a number of functions you can perform in the Memory Display window.&nbsp; Following is a description of
 these functions.
<br><br></tt><b>Dr. Watcom: Saving Window Information</b></tt>
<br>The Save items in the File menu of the Memory Display window allow you to save the current window information to a text
 file.&nbsp; Choosing Save from the File menu in the Memory Display window saves the data in the window into the current working
 directory.&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.
<br><br>Choosing Save As from the File menu allows you to specify the file to which you want to save the information currently
 in the window.&nbsp; This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.
&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.
<br><br></tt><b>Dr. Watcom: Changing the Display</b></tt>
<br>There are five ways to display the information on the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can display the information as:
<ul>
<li>Bytes
<li>Words
<li>DWords
<li>16 Bit Code
<li>32 Bit Code
</ul>
<br>To change the form of the displayed data, select an item from the Display menu.&nbsp; When displaying data in bytes, the
 data appears in the window as it physically appears in memory.&nbsp; When the data is displayed as words, the bytes in memory
 are interpreted for you so that the values displayed are those that would be obtained by treating the memory as an array
 of words.&nbsp; For example, if memory containing the values:
<br><br>12 34 56 78 9A BC DE FF
<br><br>was shown as words, the memory window would display:
<br><br>3412 7856 BC9A FFDE
<br><br>A similar interpretation is performed when the data is displayed as DWords.&nbsp; If the above memory was shown as
 DWords, the memory window would display:
<br><br>78563412 FFDEBC9A
<br><br>This rearrangement of bytes does not affect the textual interpretation of the data shown on the right hand side of
 the window.
<br><br>Selecting 16 or 32 Bit Code from the Display menu presents the data in a disassembled form.&nbsp; Sometimes presenting
 the data in disassembled form is not accurate.&nbsp; This is because when Dr.&nbsp; Watcom disassembles the data it begins
 at the first byte of the memory block and disassembles it linearly.&nbsp; If a byte in this block, such as a padding byte,
 throws off the sequence, the disassembly will be meaningless.
<br><br></tt><b>Dr. Watcom: Setting the Offset</b></tt>
<br>On the Memory Display window you can set the offset.&nbsp; This means that you can reposition the data so that the specified
 line appears at the top of the window.&nbsp; The offset you enter appears on the first line.&nbsp; It will not necessarily
 be the first piece of information because rounding often occurs to avoid breaking a line.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Offset</b> from the menu bar on the Memory Display window.
<br>This opens a Goto Offset dialog box.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw9.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 186.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Goto Offset dialog, enter the offset you want to appears at the top
 of the Memory Display window.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter the desired offset</b> that you want to position at the top of the Memory Display window.&nbsp; You can enter the
 offset in decimal or hexadecimal form.&nbsp; However, you must prefix hexadecimal values with 0x.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>This closes the dialog and positions the data as requested.
</dl>
<br></tt><b>Dr. Watcom: The Handle Information Dialog Box</b></tt>
<br>A Handle Information dialog box attached to the Memory Display window provides the following information:
<ul>
<li>Block Address
<li>Block Handle
<li>Block Size
<li>Lock Count
<li>Page Lock Count
</ul>
<br><tt><img src="drw10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 187.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Handle Information dialog box displays information about the memory object
 displayed in the Memory Display Window.</b>
<br><br>This box stays with the window when the Auto Position Info item under the File menu is checked.&nbsp; Deactivate this
 function by selecting the item again from the File menu.
<br><br>If the Handle Information dialog is not visible, reveal it by choosing Show Info from the File menu in the Memory
 Display window.&nbsp; Close this dialog by double clicking on the system menu box in its upper left hand corner.
<h4 id="Win16__Performing_a_Stack_Trace"> Win16:&nbsp; Performing a Stack Trace </h4>
<br>A program is made up of a series of functions.&nbsp; A function executes when it is called by the operating system or
 another function.&nbsp; When completed it returns to the point in the code from which it was called.
<br><br>Whenever a function is called, a stack frame is pushed onto the stack.&nbsp; When the function returns, the stack
 frame is popped from the stack.&nbsp; The stack frame contains information about the point from which the function was called
 and to which it will return.&nbsp; The collection of stack frames currently on the stack is called a call chain.
<br><br>The stack trace function lets you walk the call chain.&nbsp; This allows you to determine where each function in the
 call chain was called from and where it will return to.&nbsp; To perform a stack trace, click on the Stack Trace button in
 the Task Status dialog to reveal the Stack Trace dialog.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 188.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Stack Trace dialog allows you to walk the call chain.</b>
<br><br>When the Stack Trace dialog opens, it contains information from the stack frame for the function that was executing
 at the time of the fault.&nbsp; The Instructions Around Fault section displays the assembly instructions around the call
 to the faulting function.&nbsp; The instruction directly after the call to the faulting function is marked with an asterisk.
&nbsp; Other information includes the address of this instruction (CS:IP) and the base stack pointer (SS:BP) at the time of
 the call.&nbsp; If the faulting module contained debugging information and the marked assembly instruction corresponds to
 a source line, then source file information appears.
<br><br>Selecting the Next button displays information from the next oldest stack frame.&nbsp; This is information about the
 point from which the currently displayed function was called.&nbsp; If the currently displayed function was called by the
 operating system, then the message &quot;No more stack frames!&quot; appears because there are no stack frames for calls
 made from the operating system.
<br><br>Selecting the Prev button displays information from the next most recent stack frame.&nbsp; This moves you in the
 opposite direction along the call chain as pressing the Next button.
<br><br>The Cancel button closes the window.
<h3 id="Win16__Resetting_the_Fault_Handled_Flag"> Win16:&nbsp; Resetting the Fault Handled Flag </h3>
<br>The Reset Fault Handled Flag menu item is only accessible when an exception occurs from which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is unable
 to recover.&nbsp; When such an error occurs, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom cannot log exceptions or be terminated until you choose Reset
 Fault Handled Flag from the File menu.&nbsp; This will not happen frequently.
<h2 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Working_with_Log_Files"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Working with Log Files </h2>
<br>A log file is a text file created by Dr.&nbsp; Watcom.&nbsp; The log file consists of entries that describe the state
 of the system at the time the entry was made.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom gives you the opportunity to create a log file entry
 each time an exception occurs.&nbsp; Such entries include information about the state of the program that caused the exception,
 as well as information about the state of the system.&nbsp; You can create a log file entry at any time using the Log Current
 State menu item in the Log menu.
<br><br>A log file is a permanent record of the state of the system and, possibly, your program.&nbsp; With a log file you
 can make note of an error and return to it at a later time to examine and debug the problem.
<h3 id="Win16__Log_the_Current_State"> Win16:&nbsp; Log the Current State </h3>
<br>Choose Log Current State from the Log menu to write to the current log file.&nbsp; This tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to create
 a log file entry with all of the log details except the Offending Task Information.&nbsp; The settings in the Log Options
 dialog determine the information written to the log file.
<br><br>The Log Current State item is also available on the system menu.
<h3 id="Win16__Erase_the_Log_File"> Win16:&nbsp; Erase the Log File </h3>
<br>To erase the current log file, choose Erase Log File from the Log menu.&nbsp; This erases the log file specified in the
 Log File Options dialog.
<br><br>Choosing this item reveals a message box which asks you to verify that you want to erase the specified log file.&nbsp;
 Select yes to erase the log file or No to cancel the request.
<h3 id="Win16__Customize_the_Log_File"> Win16:&nbsp; Customize the Log File </h3>
<br>The Log Options item in the Log menu opens the Log Options dialog where you indicate to Dr.&nbsp; Watcom the information
 you want to appear in log file entries.&nbsp; The Log Options item is also available from the system menu.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw12.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 189.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Log Options dialog, you customize the log file to which you write information.</b>
<br><br>The following sections describe the options that make up the Log Options dialog.
<h4 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Naming_the_Log_File"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Naming the Log File </h4>
<br>In the Log File Name field you can specify the file to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom writes the log file entries.&nbsp; The Browse
 button to the right of this field opens the Pick Log Filename dialog.&nbsp; This dialog lets you browse your file structure
 and select the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom writes the log file entries.
<h4 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Specifying_the_Log_File_Data"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Specifying the Log File Data </h4>
<br>In the Log File Data and Disassembly Options sections of the Log File Options dialog you select the information you want
 to appear in the log file.&nbsp; The Log File Data section lists the various types of information that can be included in
 a log file.&nbsp; If the check box for a piece of information is marked then that type of information will be written to
 the log file.&nbsp; The options in this section are:
<dl>
<dt>Stack Trace
<dd>When this option is selected stack trace information for the application that caused the exception is written when a log file
 entry is made.&nbsp; This option only affects log entries made due to exceptions.
<dt><br>Current Tasks
<dd>When this option is selected a list of all tasks currently running in the system, including information about each task is
 included in each log entry.
<dt><br>All Modules
<dd>When this option is selected a list of all modules currently loaded in the system, including information about each module
 is included in each log entry.
<dt><br>GDI Heap Info
<dd>When this option is selected summary information about the state of the GDI local heap is included in each log entry.
<dt><br>User Heap Info
<dd>When this option is selected summary information about the state of the User local heap is included in each log entry.
<dt><br>Mem Manager Info
<dd>When this option is selected summary information about the state of the virtual memory manager is included in each log entry.
<dt><br>Module Segments
<dd>When this option is selected log file entries list the selectors for each module currently loaded in the system.&nbsp; The
 All Modules option must also be selected to write this information.
<dt><br>Query for Notes
<dd>When the Query for Notes option is selected Dr.&nbsp; Watcom displays an Annotate Log dialog whenever a log file entry is
 made.&nbsp; This dialog lets you enter some explanatory text that will be included in the log file entry.
<br><tt><img src="drw13.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 190.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Annotate Log dialog box, enter text you want to include in the log file
 entry.</b>
<br><br>Enter any text you want to include in the space provided.&nbsp; Press the OK button to include this text in the log
 file.&nbsp; If you press the Cancel button Dr.&nbsp; Watcom continues to create the log file entry but does not include any
 information from the dialog.
</dl>
<br>The values in the Disassembly Options box only affect log entries made due to exceptions.&nbsp; These values relate to
 the disassembly section appearing in the log file.&nbsp; The value in the Disasm Backup field tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom the
 number of instructions before the fault you want written to the log file.&nbsp; The value in the Disasm Lines field tells
 Dr.&nbsp; Watcom the total number instructions you want it to show in the log file.&nbsp; This value includes the instructions
 displayed before the fault.
<h4 id="Win16__Dr__Watcom__Other_Options"> Win16:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Other Options </h4>
<br>If the Auto Log option is selected, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom creates a log file when an exception occurs and then terminates the
 application that caused the fault instead of revealing the exception dialog.&nbsp; The Auto Log option is useful when running
 test streams.
<br><br>The Max Log File Size field allows you to set the maximum size in bytes for a log file.&nbsp; When the log file exceeds
 this size, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom prompts you with a message box when you start the application.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw14.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 191.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> A message box prompts you to erase the log file when it becomes larger than
 the maximum log file size specified on the Log File Options dialog.</b>
<br><br>This message box offers you the opportunity to delete your log file before it becomes uncontrollably large.
<h2 id="Win16__Performing_Task_Control"> Win16:&nbsp; Performing Task Control </h2>
<br>Choosing Task Control from the Task menu or the System menu opens the Task Control dialog.&nbsp; This dialog displays
 a Task List which consists of all programs currently running under Windows.&nbsp; The Task Control dialog lets you terminate
 and debug tasks.
<br><br>The task list in the Task Control dialog is different from the system Task List which appears when you double click
 on the wallpaper.&nbsp; The system Task List list displays only applications that currently have a window open on the desktop.
&nbsp; The task list in the Task Control dialog lists all tasks regardless of whether they have a window open.
<h3 id="Win16__Terminating_a_Task"> Win16:&nbsp; Terminating a Task </h3>
<br>The Kill Task button on the Task Control dialog terminates a task listed in the Task List.&nbsp; This function is extremely
 powerful.&nbsp; It allows you to terminate programs immediately without giving them the opportunity to clean up by saving
 data, unloading DLLs, and freeing allocated memory.
<br><br>For this reason, you should exercise care when using this function.&nbsp; It is wise to only use the Kill Task function
 for tasks that cannot be terminated in the usual way.
<dl>
<dt>To terminate a task:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Task Control</b> from the Task menu.
<br>This opens the Task Control dialog containing a list of all tasks currently running in the system.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw15.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

<h2 id="Win32__Dr__Watcom__Exception_Handling"> Win32:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Exception Handling </h2>
<br>When a fatal error, or exception, occurs in a process to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is attached, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom intercepts
 the exception.&nbsp; By intercepting the exception, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom halts the program's execution to prevent it from terminating.
&nbsp; When an exception occurs, a Dr.&nbsp; Watcom exception dialog box appears on the screen indicating that a fatal error
 has occurred.&nbsp; This dialog displays information about the error and gives you several options.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 198.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The exception dialog appears when a fatal error occurs in a program.</b>
<br><br>The information displayed about the error includes:
<dl>
<dt>Process Name
<dd>The name of the process in which the error occurred.
<dt><br>Process ID
<dd>The unique identifier associated with the process.
<dt><br>Fault Type
<dd>The type of fault that occurred.
<dt><br>Fault CS:EIP
<dd>The address of the instruction being executed when the fault occurred.
<dt><br>Source Info
<dd>The source line on which the error occurred.&nbsp; This only appears if the program running contains debugging information
 and the exception occurred on an assembly instruction that corresponds to a source line.
</dl>
<br>There are four buttons on the exception dialog that you can use to proceed.
<dl>
<dt>Act
<dd>When the Act button is pressed Dr.&nbsp; Watcom's action is determined by the option currently selected in the &quot;action
 to take&quot; section of the dialog.&nbsp; The following describes the action taken for each option.
<dl>
<dt>Terminate Task
<dd>When the Terminate Task radio button is selected choosing Act causes the faulting process to be terminated immediately.
<dt><br>Restart Instruction
<dd>When the Restart Instruction radio button is selected choosing Act causes the faulting process to restart execution starting
 with the instruction pointed to by its CS:EIP.&nbsp; This option is primarily used to restart a process after you have changed
 its register values using the Process Status dialog.
<dt><br>Chain to Next Handler
<dd>A handler is a piece of code, a program, or a routine that gets called when an exception occurs.&nbsp; A process can have
 several exception handlers.&nbsp; When the Chain to Next Handler radio button is selected choosing Act tells the operating
 system to continue searching for a handler to deal with this exception.&nbsp; If no handler is found for the exception then
 Dr.&nbsp; Watcom will redisplay the exception dialog to give you a second chance to deal with the exception.&nbsp; During
 this second chance notification the chain to next handler option is not available.&nbsp; This option is useful for testing
 your own exception handling code.
</dl>
<dt><br>Act and Log
<dd>Choosing the Act and Log button first creates a log file entry recording information about this exception then takes the same
 action that would result from choosing the Act button.
<dt><br>Registers
<dd>Select the Registers button to open the Process Status dialog.&nbsp; This dialog gives you additional information on the state
 of the process when the exception occurred.&nbsp; From this window you can change the registers and flags and view the process's
 address space.&nbsp; Refer to the section entitled <a href="#Win32__Examining_the_Process_Status">Win32:&nbsp; Examining the Process Status</a>
 for further information.

</dl>
<h3 id="Win32__Using_External_Exception_Handlers"> Win32:&nbsp; Using External Exception Handlers </h3>
<br>You can use the Continue Exceptions item in the file menu to tell Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to only report on exceptions that are
 not handled by another exception handler.&nbsp; When this item is checked Dr.&nbsp; Watcom only displays an exception dialog
 if the system is unable to find a handler for an exception.&nbsp; This behavior is the same as when Continue Exceptions is
 not checked and chain to next handler is selected on the exception dialog.
<h3 id="Win32__Examining_the_Process_Status"> Win32:&nbsp; Examining the Process Status </h3>
<br>The Process Status dialog appears when you choose the Registers button in the exception dialog.
<br><br>This dialog displays information in four sections:
<ul>
<li>Source Information
<li>Registers
<li>Flags
<li>Instructions Around Fault
</ul>
<br>The Source Information section indicates the source file where the error occurred and the line of that source file.&nbsp;
 In order to get source information, your program must contain debugging information.&nbsp; N/A appears in the Source Information
 section if the program does not contain debugging information or the exception occurred on an assembly instruction that does
 not correspond to a source file.
<br><br>The Registers and Flags sections display information in the CPU at the time of the exception.
<br><br>The Instructions Around Fault section displays the assembly instructions surrounding the instruction that was being
 executed when the fault occurred.&nbsp; An asterisk marks the instruction to which the CS:EIP is currently pointing.
<br><br>When the Show Symbols box is checked, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom tries to replace addresses in the assembly code with symbolic
 names.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can only replace addresses if the faulting module contained debugging information.&nbsp; If
 this box is not checked, addresses appear as numeric values.
<h4 id="Win32__Dr__Watcom__Changing_the_Registers"> Win32:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Changing the Registers </h4>
<br>In the Process Status dialog you can set up testing and debugging situations by changing the values of the registers and
 flags.&nbsp; To change a register value simply enter a new value in the edit field that contains the current register value.
&nbsp; To change the state of a flag register just check or uncheck the check box associated with that flag.&nbsp; A flag
 has a value of 1 when its check box is checked.
<br><br>The register and flag values will not take effect until you choose OK on the Process Status dialog.
<h4 id="Win32__Dr__Watcom__Applying_Registers"> Win32:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Applying Registers </h4>
<br>Selecting the Apply Registers button on the Process Status dialog after making changes to the registers and flags updates
 the displayed information based on your changes.
<h4 id="Win32__Dr__Watcom__Viewing_Memory"> Win32:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Viewing Memory </h4>
<br>Selecting the View Memory button in the Process Status dialog opens a Memory Walk window which allows you to view the
 address space of the process that caused the exception.
<br><br>The information in this window appears under the following headings:
<dl>
<dt>Base
<dd>This is the address where this memory object begins.
<dt><br>AllocBase
<dd>The is the address where the allocation object begins.&nbsp; This tells you which allocation object a memory object belongs
 to.
<dt><br>Size
<dd>This is the size of the memory object.
<dt><br>Prot
<dd>Codes indicating what you can do with the memory.&nbsp; The codes are:
<ul>
<li>RO-Read Only
<li>NA-Not applicable
<li>ExRO-Executable and Read Only
<li>RW-Read, Write
<li>WC-Write, Copy
<li>Ex-Executable
<li>ExRW-Executable, Read, Write
<li>ExWC-Executable, Write, Copy
</ul>
<dt><br>State
<dd>The state of the memory.&nbsp; Values are:
<ul>
<li>Free-range of addresses not being used
<li>Committed-range of addresses refers to memory that exists
<li>Reserved-this range of addresses has been set aside for future use but no memory exists for the addresses
</ul>
<dt><br>Object
<dd>Information indicating what the memory is being used for.&nbsp; This field is only completed if Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can provide
 useful information.
<dt><br>Image
<dd>The name of the module that owns the memory object.&nbsp; This field is only completed if Dr.&nbsp; Watcom can provide useful
 information.
</dl>
<br>From this window you can select a memory object and view its contents.&nbsp; To view this information, double click on
 the desired object.&nbsp; This opens a Memory Range window for the selected object.&nbsp; This window displays all of the
 data stored in the selected object.&nbsp; The data appears in hexadecimal form.&nbsp; This window allows you to see if the
 data in memory is what you believe it should be.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>You can only view memory for an object whose state is Committed since there is no memory associated with other objects.
</dl>
<br>There are a number of functions you can perform in the Memory Range window.&nbsp; Following is a description of these
 functions.
<br><br></tt><b>Dr. Watcom: Saving Window Information</b></tt>
<br>The Save items in the File menu on the Memory Range window allows you to save the currently displayed information to a
 text file.&nbsp; Choosing Save from the File menu on the Memory Range window saves the data in the window into the current
 working directory.&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.&nbsp; 
<br><br>Choosing Save As from the File menu allows you to specify the file to which you want to save the data currently in
 the window.&nbsp; This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.&nbsp;
 A message box appears indicating the path to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom saved the file.
<br><br></tt><b>Dr. Watcom: Changing the Display</b></tt>
<br>There are three ways to display the information in the Memory Range window.&nbsp; You can display the information as:
<ul>
<li>Bytes
<li>Words
<li>DWords
</ul>
<br>To change the form of the displayed data, select an item from the Display menu.&nbsp; When displaying data in bytes, the
 data appears in the window as it physically appears in memory.&nbsp; When the data is displayed as words, the bytes in memory
 are interpreted for you so that the values displayed are those that would be obtained by treating the memory as an array
 of words.&nbsp; For example, if memory containing the values:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 34 56 78 9A BC DE FF</tt>
<br><br>was shown as words, the memory window would display:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3412 7856 BC9A FFDE</tt>
<br><br>A similar interpretation is performed when the data is displayed as DWords.&nbsp; If the above memory was shown as
 DWords, the memory window would display:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78563412 FFDEBC9A</tt>
<br><br>This rearrangement of bytes does not affect the textual interpretation of the data shown on the right hand side of
 the window.
<br><br></tt><b>Dr. Watcom: Setting the Offset</b></tt>
<br>In the Memory Range window you can set the offset.&nbsp; This means that you can reposition the data so that specific
 information appears at the top of the window.&nbsp; The offset you enter appears on the first line.&nbsp; It will not necessarily
 be the first piece of information because rounding often occurs to avoid breaking a line.&nbsp; 
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Offset</b> from the menu bar on the Memory Display window.
<br>This opens a Goto Offset dialog box.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter the desired offset</b> that you want to position at the top of the Memory Range window.&nbsp; You can enter the
 offset in decimal or hexadecimal form.&nbsp; However, you must prefix hexadecimal values with 0x.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>&nbsp; This closes the dialog and positions the data as requested.
</dl>

<dt><br>Current Processes
<dd>When this box is checked, each log file entry includes a list of all processes currently running in the system, including
 information about each process.
<dt><br>Mem Manager Info
<dd>When this box is checked, log file entries will include summary information on the memory usage of the process that caused
 the exception.&nbsp; This option affects only log file entries created because of an exception.
</dl>
<br>The fields in the Disassembly Options section relate to the disassembly section appearing in the log file.&nbsp; These
 fields affect only log file entries made because of exceptions.
<ul>
<li>The value in the Disasm Backup field tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom the number of instructions before the fault you want written
 to the log file.
<li>The value in the Disasm Lines field tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom the total number of instructions you want it to show in the
 log file.&nbsp; This value includes the instructions displayed before the fault.
</ul>
<h4 id="Win32__Dr__Watcom__Other_Options"> Win32:&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:&nbsp; Other Options </h4>
<br>When the Auto Log option is selected, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom creates a log file when an exception occurs and then terminates
 the application instead of revealing the exception dialog.
<br><br>The Max Log File Size option allows you to set the maximum size in bytes for a log file.&nbsp; When the log file exceeds
 this size, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom prompts you with a message box when you start the application.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw14.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 201.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> A message box prompts you to erase the log file when it becomes larger than
 the maximum log file size specified on the Log File Options dialog.</b>
<br><br>This message box offers you the opportunity to delete your log file before it becomes uncontrollably large.
<h2 id="Win32__Attaching_Processes_to_Dr__Watcom"> Win32:&nbsp; Attaching Processes to Dr.&nbsp; Watcom </h2>
<br>Attaching processes to Dr.&nbsp; Watcom enables it to monitor events that occur within the processes.&nbsp; When processes
 are attached, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom reports on events that occur within your process, such as DLL loads, thread creations, and
 thread terminations.&nbsp; Attaching also allows Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to detect exceptions in your process.
<br><br>There are four ways to attach processes to Dr.&nbsp; Watcom:
<ul>
<li>Command line
<li>Add New process menu item
<li>Auto Add Process feature
<li>Process Control dialog
</ul>
<br>Dr.&nbsp; Watcom cannot detach from processes to which it is attached.&nbsp; The attachment exists until the process terminates.
&nbsp; If you try to close Dr.&nbsp; Watcom while it is attached to processes, a warning box appears listing the processes
 to which Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is still attached.
<br><br>Select Yes or No to continue.
<h3 id="Win32__Command_Line"> Win32:&nbsp; Command Line </h3>
<br>You can run a program and attach Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to it at start-up by passing the path of the executable to Dr.&nbsp;
 Watcom as a command line parameter.&nbsp; For example, to run the program<tt> foo.exe</tt> and attach Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to
 it, type:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drwatcom foo.exe</tt>
<br><br>If you often want to run a certain program with Dr.&nbsp; Watcom attached to it then you can create a Program Manager
 icon that runs Dr.&nbsp; Watcom with the name of the program as a command line parameter.
<br><br>Double clicking on the icon when Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is not running causes Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to start-up.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;
 Watcom then starts the specified process and attaches to it immediately.
<br><br>Double clicking on the icon when there is already an instance of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom running causes the existing instance
 of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to run the specified process and attach to it.&nbsp; The second Dr.&nbsp; Watcom terminates immediately
 so that only one instance of Dr.&nbsp; Watcom is left running.
<h3 id="Win32__Add_New_Process"> Win32:&nbsp; Add New Process </h3>
<br>The Add New Process item in the Process menu is another way to start a new process and attach to it immediately.
<dl>
<dt>To start a new process using this item:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Add New Process</b> from the Process menu.
<br>This opens the Load Process dialog where you browse the file structure.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select the program</b> you want to start with Dr.&nbsp; Watcom attached.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Click on OK.</b>
<br>This runs the selected program and attaches to it immediately.
</dl>
<h3 id="Win32__Auto_Add_Processes"> Win32:&nbsp; Auto Add Processes </h3>
<br>Checking the Auto Add Process item in the Process menu tells Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to attach to all new processes that start
 in the system.&nbsp; When you activate this feature, Dr.&nbsp; Watcom checks the system every few seconds for new processes.
&nbsp; When it finds them, it attaches to them.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Watcom will not automatically attach to processes that began
 before the Auto Add Process item was checked.
<br><br>The disadvantage of this feature is that in the few seconds between Dr.&nbsp; Watcom's process checks, your process
 can start-up, run, and possibly cause an exception.&nbsp; When this occurs, a system dialog box appears reporting the error.
&nbsp; Selecting OK on this dialog immediately may not allow Dr.&nbsp; Watcom sufficient time to attach to the faulting process.
&nbsp; Wait for a few seconds and select the OK button on this dialog.&nbsp; The dialog closes and Dr.&nbsp; Watcom attaches
 to the faulting process.&nbsp; The Dr.&nbsp; Watcom exception dialog then appears and you can proceed as usual.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Occasionally, when this feature is active a message box may appear saying, &quot;An unexpected failure occurred while processing
 a DebugActiveProcess API request.&nbsp; You may choose OK to terminate the process or Cancel to ignore the error&quot;.&nbsp;
 This message results from a known limitation in Win32.&nbsp; If it appears simply choose Cancel.
</dl>
<h3 id="Win32__Process_Control"> Win32:&nbsp; Process Control </h3>
<br>Using the Add Process button on the Process Control dialog, you can attach Dr.&nbsp; Watcom to any process that is currently
 running in the system.
<dl>
