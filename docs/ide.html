<h1 id="Open_Watcom_Integrated_Development_Environment"> Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment </h1>
<br>Software development normally involves managing a number of different files for each project.&nbsp; A project often includes
 multiple source files, include files, and libraries.&nbsp; In addition, there are usually several programming tools involved:
&nbsp; compilers, linkers, preprocessors, debuggers, editors, and so on.&nbsp; But this is likely not new to you.&nbsp; What
 will be new is the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
<br><br>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment is a software development tool that manages project files and language
 tools.&nbsp; Although it is really a tool itself, the common term to describe it (and possibly the best analogy) is<b> Development
 Environment.</b>&nbsp; By using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, you have direct access to each of the
 files relating to a project and all of the language tools you require to build your application.
<br><br><img src="ide_s.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle">
<h2 id="How_the_Environment_Operates"> How the Environment Operates </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment has a graphical interface that combines file management and tool management.
&nbsp; An IDE session deals with a<b> Project.</b>&nbsp; A project can be generally defined as the collection of files and
 necessary information that relates to the development of project components.&nbsp; However, a project is more than just a
 graphical representation of a file list-it contains all of the underlying smarts to understand the interrelation of all files
 associated with the project and to ensure that these files are up-to-date.
<br><br>Each project component is referred to as a<b> Target.</b>&nbsp; An Integrated Development Environment target is made
 up of the source files, include files, libraries, and MAKE instructions to create the target file (for example, &quot;.exe&quot;,
 &quot;.dll&quot;, &quot;.lib&quot;, or &quot;.hlp&quot;).&nbsp; A project often has more than one target.&nbsp; Each target
 can be set to create the associated target file for a specific destination platform.
<br><br>Within a target, there are<b> Sources.</b>&nbsp; A source is an individual file (such as a &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.cpp&quot;
 file, but it can also be a &quot;.bmp&quot;, &quot;.rc&quot;, or &quot;.lib&quot; file) used to create the target file.&nbsp;
 A target usually has more than one source.
<h2 id="How_the_Integrated_Development_Environment_Looks"> How the Integrated Development Environment Looks </h2>
<br>In the following illustration, the main window is the project window for a project entitled<tt> first.wpj.</tt>&nbsp;
 The sub-window represents the target for this project,<tt> target1.exe.</tt>&nbsp; The source file for the target is listed
 within the target window.&nbsp; In this project, there is only a single target with a single source file.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide1.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 1.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom IDE window displays project and target windows.</b>
<br><br>The language tools are available on the toolbar and the drop-down menus.&nbsp; For example, on the Sources menu, you
 can work with the source that is selected in the target window.&nbsp; Here you can add a new source, remove or rename an
 existing source, edit a source, and so on.&nbsp; A similar set of target actions are available in the Targets menu and project
 actions are located in the File menu.
<br><br>A single IDE session displays a project.&nbsp; If the project consists of a number of components, such as two executables
 and one library, these appear as target sub-windows on the project window.&nbsp; Each target window displays the files necessary
 to construct the target and associates files with a rule describing the construction mechanism based on filename extension.
&nbsp; For example, a filename with the extension &quot;.exe&quot; may associate with the rule for constructing executables,
 or a filename with the extension &quot;.lib&quot; may associate with the rule for constructing static libraries.
<br><br>Different projects can refer to the same target.&nbsp; If they do, either project can manipulate the shared target
 and any changes to either project affect the shared target.
<h2 id="The_Files_the_Integrated_Development_Environment_Uses"> The Files the Integrated Development Environment Uses </h2>
<br>The Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment creates and manages a project, referencing a number of targets.&nbsp;
 The IDE uses filename extensions to represent projects and targets.&nbsp; The extension &quot;.wpj&quot; represents projects
 and the extension &quot;.tgt&quot; represents targets.&nbsp; The IDE compiles and links the target in the target directory.
<br><br>The project file (.wpj) contains the names of all of the target files related to the project, including housekeeping
 information about the project and the current IDE session.
<br><br>Each target file (.tgt) describes one target and includes the name and type of the target executable, a reference
 to a rule describing how to build the target, and a list of relevant switches the rule uses.&nbsp; In addition, target files
 also contain the names of all of the source files used to construct the target program, references to similar rules for compiling
 them, and relevant switches.
<br><br>In constructing targets, the Integrated Development Environment references a list of rules defined in a configuration
 file, called<tt> ide.cfg.</tt>&nbsp; Each rule defines a command line used to do the construction and a list of actions you
 can perform on the target program (such as make, run, or debug) or on the files in the item list (such as make or edit).
&nbsp; Additionally, rules refer to tools.
<br><br>Tools define which command line switches you can use in the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment.

<h3 id="The_IDE_Status_Bar"> The IDE Status Bar </h3>
<br>The Status Bar appears along the bottom of the Open Watcom IDE Project window.&nbsp; This bar displays hint text for the
 toolbar button and menu option over which your cursor is positioned.&nbsp; Status messages, such as Saving, Adding, and Executing
 Log, appear in this bar so you are aware of what action the IDE is performing.&nbsp; A check mark beside the Show Status
 Bar menu option in the File menu indicates that this feature is enabled.&nbsp; To disable this feature, choose the option
 again from the File menu and the status bar disappears from the window.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 2.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The IDE Status Bar can be toggled from the File menu.</b>
<h3 id="The_IDE_Toolbar"> The IDE Toolbar </h3>
<br>In the Open Watcom IDE Project window, the toolbar appears below the menu bar when the Show Tool Bar option in the File
 menu is activated (default).&nbsp; A check mark beside the menu option indicates that it is enabled.&nbsp; To disable this
 feature, choose the option again from the File menu and the toolbar disappears.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide3.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 3.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> You can access thirteen IDE functions from the toolbar.</b>
<br><br>The following explains the function each icon performs, as well as the equivalent function on the menu bar.

<h2 id="Getting_Started_with_a_Short_Tutorial"> Getting Started with a Short Tutorial </h2>
<br>Perhaps the easiest way to understand how the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment manages an entire project's
 files and tools, is to work through a brief example.&nbsp; In this walk-through, you create and execute a simple C program
 using the IDE.&nbsp; FORTRAN developers can follow along substituting FORTRAN code and file names where appropriate.&nbsp;
 The session will help you understand the basic concepts of the IDE and the steps involved in project development.
<br><br>The illustrations shown in this section are taken from the Windows environment.&nbsp; The OS/2 environment is very
 similar with some minor differences.&nbsp; For example, in the OS/2 environment the IDE uses the OS/2 Editor rather than
 Open Watcom's Windows Editor.&nbsp; Although this tutorial builds a Win32 executable, you can choose to build a Win16 or
 OS/2 PM executable.&nbsp; The procedures to follow are not that much different.&nbsp; When the time comes to select the type
 of target, simply choose an environment that you can run on your machine so that you can run your application to make sure
 it works.
<h3 id="A_Simple_Executable"> A Simple Executable </h3>
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Double-click on the IDE icon</b> in the Open Watcom Tools window.
<br>The Open Watcom IDE Project window appears.&nbsp; 
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose New Project</b> from the File menu.
<br>The Enter Project Filename dialog appears.&nbsp; The default project name is<tt> noname.wpj.</tt>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Enter the filename</b><tt> \project\first</tt> in the File Name field and click on OK.
<br><tt><img src="ide4.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 4.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Enter the filename in the Enter Project Filename dialog.</b>
<br><br>This is the name of the project you are creating.&nbsp; If you enter a directory that doesn't exist (in this case,<tt>
 \project</tt>), the IDE reveals a message box asking if you want to create the specified directory.&nbsp; Click on OK to
 create the specified directory and project file.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>The IDE looks for existing projects with the new name.&nbsp; If a project with the specified name already exists, the IDE
 will prompt you rather than simply overwriting the existing project.
</dl>
<br>The project name appears in the title bar of the Open Watcom IDE Project window.&nbsp; Note that the IDE added the extension
 &quot;.wpj&quot; to the project name.&nbsp; The New Target dialog appears on the screen where you define a target for the
 new project.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Enter the desired target name</b> in the Target Name field (we suggest<tt> target1</tt>).&nbsp; Next, select the appropriate
 Target Environment (we suggest &quot;Win32&quot;) and Image Type (we suggest &quot;Character-mode Executable&quot;).&nbsp;
 Click on OK when completed.
<br><tt><img src="ide5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 5.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Select target name, target environment and image type</b>
<br><br>The New Target dialog closes and the IDE creates a target window entitled<tt> target1.exe</tt> for the new target.
&nbsp; Note that the IDE appends the appropriate extension to the target name for you once you click on OK.&nbsp; You can
 now add sources to the target.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Choose New Source</b> from the Sources menu.
<br>The Add File(s) dialog appears where you specify the sources you want to add to the target.&nbsp; Source names must be
 filenames with extensions; pathnames are not required.
<br><br>For the OS/2 IDE, you can add multiple source files to the target at one time by inserting a space between each filename
 you enter.&nbsp; You can also use the file browser to add files by clicking on the Browse...&nbsp; button.
<br><br>For all other systems, you can enter the names of the source files (with extensions) in the File Name field or you
 can use the file browser to select files.&nbsp; The type of files displayed in file list window can be controlled by modifying
 the List Files of Type field.&nbsp; Once you have typed a name in the File Name field or selected a name from the file list,
 you can add it to the list of source files to be included by clicking the Add button.&nbsp; All files in the file list can
 be added by clicking the Add All button.&nbsp; Individual names can be removed from the &quot;add&quot; list by selecting
 them and clicking the Remove button.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide6.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 6.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Select source file names in the Add File(s) dialog</b>
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Enter the following source file names.</b>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source1.c&nbsp;&nbsp; (or source1.for)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source2.c&nbsp;&nbsp; (or source2.for)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source3.rc</tt>
<br><br>For the OS/2 IDE, enter all the names into the field separating each name by a space.&nbsp; Click on OK when done.
<br><br>For all other systems, enter one name at a time into the File Name field, pressing Enter or clicking on Add after
 each one has been entered.&nbsp; Click on Close when done.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide7.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 7.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Enter one or several source files in the Add File(s) dialog.</b>
<br><br>The IDE adds the new source files to the target window, followed by the characters &#91;n/a&#93;.&nbsp; This indicates
 that the source files are not available, meaning that the files do not yet exist.&nbsp; The indicators are:
<dl>
<dt>&#91;n/a&#93;
<dd>This code appears if the file does not exist.
<dt><br>&#91;r/o&#93;
<dd>This code appears if the file is Read Only.
<dt><br>&#91;sw&#93;
<dd>This code appears if the user has set switches for the specified source file.
</dl>
<br>The Integrated Development Environment organizes the source files in the target window under headers according to the
 filename extension.&nbsp; You can expand and collapse the file groups by clicking on the folder icon.
<br><br>For this tutorial, we only need one source file, so now we will delete the extra files from the target.
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Click on the file</b><tt> source2.c</tt> (or<tt> source2.for</tt>) to select it then choose Remove Source from the Sources
 menu.
<br>A message box appears asking if you want to remove the selected source.&nbsp; Click on the Yes button to continue.&nbsp;
 The IDE removes the selected source file from the target window.&nbsp; Now we can remove<tt> source3.rc.</tt>&nbsp; To do
 this we will perform the function of removing all source files with a common extension.
<dt><br>(8)
<dd><b> Click on the (.rc) header</b> on the target window then choose Remove Source from the Sources menu.
<br>A message box appears on the screen asking if you want to remove all of the &quot;.rc&quot; files.&nbsp; Click on the
 Yes button to continue.&nbsp; The message box closes and the IDE removes the<tt> source3.rc</tt> file from the target window.
&nbsp; Now you can edit the remaining source file.
<dt><br>(9)
<dd><b> Highlight the line</b><tt> source1.c</tt> (or<tt> source1.for</tt>) and choose Edit Text from the Sources menu to edit
 the selected source file.
<br>The Open Watcom Editor appears.&nbsp; The name of the selected source file,<tt> source1.c</tt> (or<tt> source1.for</tt>),
 appears in the window.&nbsp; Here you can enter the source code.
<br><br><b><i>Hint:</i></b>&nbsp; You can also invoke the Open Watcom Editor by double-clicking on the source file that you
 want to edit.
<br><br>In this case, the Open Watcom Editor appears because the selected source file has a &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.for&quot;
 extension.&nbsp; Performing an edit can open different editors, depending on the extension of the selected source file.
<dt><br>(10)
<dd><b> Enter the following lines of source code.</b>
<dl>
<dt>Important:
<dd>For the purpose of this session, we ask you to enter<b> ii</b> instead of<b> i</b> in the &quot;print&quot; line.&nbsp; This
 will allow you to see how the Integrated Development Environment reacts to errors.&nbsp; You will then be able to correct
 the error.
</dl>

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getchar();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><br>FORTRAN programmers can enter the following lines of code.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end</tt>
<br><br>You can now save your work and close the Editor in one of the following two ways:&nbsp; close down the entire editor
 or close down only the source file window.&nbsp; For this exercise, close only the source file window as follows.
<dt><br>(11)
<dd><b> Choose Close</b> from the File menu to close down the current source file window.
<br>In both cases, if changes have been made to the file and not saved, a message prompts you to save the changes before exiting.
&nbsp; The advantage of closing only the Editor window is that the Editor continues to run.&nbsp; If you need to access it
 again, you will not need to wait for it to go through the start-up procedures again.

<h3 id="Review_of_What_Happened"> Review of What Happened </h3>
<br>In this session, you created a project called<tt> first.wpj.</tt>&nbsp; This project had one target called<tt> target1.exe,</tt>
 a 32-bit Windows executable (unless you specified another target type).&nbsp; Using the Open Watcom Editor, you entered and
 edited the source text in a file called<tt> source1.c</tt> or<tt> source1.for</tt> (if you tried the FORTRAN example).&nbsp;
 You compiled and linked it into an executable program using the Open Watcom Make utility, a Open Watcom compiler, and the
 Open Watcom Linker.&nbsp; You ran it directly and under the control of the Open Watcom Debugger.
<br><br>When you saved the project, the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment created the following permanent files:
<dl>
<dt>first.wpj
<dd>Describes the screen layout and refers to a file called<tt> target1.tgt</tt>

<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Enter the target name</b> in the Target Name field.
<br>Enter the entire pathname to ensure the directory is created where you want.&nbsp; Depending on the nature of the target,
 it may or may not be able to share the same directory as other pre-existing targets.&nbsp; Generally, if the target shares
 one or more of the same source files as other targets in the project, then it must be placed in its own subdirectory.&nbsp;
 The object files that are produced for the target may have different attributes than a pre-existing target's object files
 (e.g., 16-bit vs 32-bit).&nbsp; This is why the target should be placed in a separate subdirectory.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Select the desired Target Environment and Image Type</b> as desired.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> when the Target Name, Target Environment and Image Type fields are correct.
<br>If you specify a new directory in the target pathname, a message box appears asking if you want to create the specified

<h3 id="Removing_a_Target"> Removing a Target </h3>
<br>The procedure for removing a target from a project is simple.&nbsp; If your project has multiple targets, it is important
 to ensure that the target you want to remove is the one selected.&nbsp; Removing a target does not permanently delete the
 target, it simply removes it from the current project.&nbsp; If the target is attached to multiple projects, those projects
 will not be affected by the removal of the selected target from the current project.
<dl>
<dt>To remove a target from the current project:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target window</b> you want to remove from the project.
<br>The title bar of the selected target window is highlighted.

</dl>
<h3 id="Marking_a_Target_for_Remake"> Marking a Target for Remake </h3>
<br>Marking a target for remake ensures that the IDE will perform the link the next time you make that target or make all
 targets.&nbsp; This function is necessary if you are not using the Autodepend function in the Setup Target submenu under
 the Targets menu.&nbsp; By marking a target for remake, you control when and which targets need to be remade.
<dl>
<dt>To mark a target for remake:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target window</b> you want to mark.
<br>The title bar of the selected target window is highlighted.

<dd><b> Choose Mark Target for Remake</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>A message box appears asking if you want to also mark all of the source files of the selected target.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Yes or No</b> to continue.
<br>Choosing Yes marks all of the source files for the selected target as well as the target itself.&nbsp; This means that
 the next time you do a make, the source files for the selected target will be compiled.&nbsp; Choosing No marks only the
 selected target for remake.&nbsp; In both cases, the message box closes and you return to the Open Watcom IDE Project window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Making_Targets"> Making Targets </h3>
<br>The Make function in the Targets menu creates an executable for the selected target.&nbsp; When you perform this function,
 the IDE compiles the source files for the selected target into object files.&nbsp; The object files are then linked together
 to create the target file.
<br><br>There are two make functions available to you for targets:&nbsp; Make and Make All.&nbsp; The Make All function in
 the Actions menu tells the IDE to compile and link all of the targets for the current project.&nbsp; This can be a lengthy
 process, depending upon the number of targets in your project, so you may choose to only make targets to which changes have
 been made.&nbsp; This enables you to see if they can be made successfully.
<br><br>Performing the Make function opens the IDE Log window which allows you to monitor the progress of the make.
<dl>
<dt>To make a single target:
<dd>

<h3 id="Setting_Application_Parameters"> Setting Application Parameters </h3>
<br>The Targets and Sources menus and their submenus are divided into sections.&nbsp; Horizontal lines separate each section.
&nbsp; The menu items in the bottom sections of the Targets and Sources menus are actions that you can perform on the selected
 target or source file in the current project.&nbsp; If there are switches that can be set for these actions, there are corresponding
 menu item entries in the bottom sections of the submenus.&nbsp; Choose Target Options and Source Options from their respective
 menus to display the submenus.
<h2 id="Working_with_Source_Files"> Working with Source Files </h2>
<br>Once your project has a target you need to add source files to the target.&nbsp; The procedure for adding a source file
 to a target is simple.&nbsp; Once you have source files that make up your target, you can also change the name of a source
 file and remove source files.&nbsp; This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Adding Source Files
<li>Removing Source Files
<li>Renaming a Source File
<li>Marking a Source File for Remake
<li>Making Source Files
<li>Viewing Included Files
</ul>
<h3 id="Adding_Source_Files"> Adding Source Files </h3>
<br>You add source files to the selected target (the target whose title bar is currently highlighted) using the Add File(s)
 dialog.&nbsp; The current project must have a target in order to use the New Source function.&nbsp; You have two options
 when adding source files to a target:&nbsp; you can either enter the name of a new source file or you can choose an existing
 source file.&nbsp; When adding existing source files you can use the file browser, type sources one at a time into the Add
 File(s) dialog, or use wild cards in the Add File(s) dialog.&nbsp; This section describes all methods for adding source files.
<br><br>The extension you use with the source file name determines the compiler that the IDE uses to create the target.&nbsp;
 For example, the &quot;.c&quot; extension, invokes the Open Watcom C compiler to make the target.&nbsp; You can specify several
 different compilers:
<dl>
<dt>xxx.asm
<dd>The &quot;.asm&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom Assembler.
<dt><br>xxx.c
<dd>The &quot;.c&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom C compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.cpp
<dd>The &quot;.cpp&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom C++ compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.for
<dd>The &quot;.for&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.hlp
<dd>The &quot;.hlp&quot; extension invokes either the Win16, OS/2, or Win32 compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.rc
<dd>The &quot;.rc&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom resource compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.res
<dd>The &quot;.res&quot; extension invokes the Open Watcom Resource Editor.
<dt><br>xxx.sqc
<dd>The &quot;.sqc&quot; extension invokes the embedded SQL preprocessor and the Open Watcom C compiler.
<dt><br>xxx.sqp
<dd>The &quot;.sqp&quot; extension invokes the embedded SQL preprocessor and the Open Watcom C++ compiler.

<br><b><i>Figure 28.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Use the C Compiler Switches dialog to set switches for the compiler associated
 with the selected source file(s).</b>
<br><br>The first of several compiler switch dialogs appears.&nbsp; Of note is the sixth screen, Debugging Switches, which
 allows you to choose the debugging information you want to see.&nbsp; Remember, if the option Use Development Switches is
 enabled in the Target Options submenu of the Targets menu, the Integrated Development Environment automatically sets switches
 to include all debugging information.&nbsp; You can change this setting by selecting Use Release Switches from the Target
 Options submenu under the Targets menu or choosing specific switches in the Switches dialogs.
<br><br>Select the<b> CopyRel</b> button in the Switches dialog to copy the set of Release switches to the current dialog.
&nbsp; You can then make further changes, as required.&nbsp; This button is available only if the Development switches are

<h3 id="Using_the_Autodepend_Switch"> Using the Autodepend Switch </h3>
<br>The Use Autodepend switch in the Target Options submenu of the Targets menu keeps track of updated source files.&nbsp;
 Once a source is modified, the IDE remembers that it needs to be recompiled the next time you do a make.&nbsp; By using the
 Use Autodepend switch, the IDE also keeps track of changes made to source files on which other source files depend.
<br><br>For example, let's say that your current project has a source file,<tt> source.cpp,</tt> that depends on a header
 file,<tt> source.hpp.</tt>&nbsp; If the Use Autodepend feature is not enabled and changes are made to<tt> source.hpp</tt>
 after<tt> source.cpp</tt> in your current project has been compiled, the IDE does not recognize that your current source
 file is now out of date.&nbsp; This means that the next time you do a make, the IDE will not compile<tt> source.cpp.</tt>
&nbsp; The Use Autodepend feature tells the IDE to compare the date and time stamps on all of the dependent source files in
 addition to the source files in the current project and their corresponding object files, so the IDE recognizes when your
 current source file needs to be recompiled.
<dl>
<dt>To set the Use Autodepend switch:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Target Options</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>A submenu appears from the Target Options menu.&nbsp; A check mark beside the menu option indicates that it is enabled.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select the Use Autodepend option</b> from the Target Options submenu.
<br>If the option was enabled when you selected it, you have disabled the Use Autodepend feature.&nbsp; If the option had
 no check mark when you selected it, you have enabled the Use Autodepend feature.
</dl>
<h2 id="Configuring_the_Integrated_Development_Environment"> Configuring the Integrated Development Environment </h2>
<br>The Integrated Development Environment can be reconfigured to some extent.&nbsp; You can customize the following features.
<ul>
<li>Show or hide the Toolbar
<li>Show or hide the Status Bar
<li>Enable or disable automatic updates of file status in the target windows
<li>Select your own text editor
<li>Select a source revision control system
</ul>
<br>The next few sections describe these features.
<h3 id="Show_Toolbar"> Show Toolbar </h3>
<br>The Integrated Development Environment Toolbar that appears under the Menu Bar can be removed from or added to the IDE
 window.
<dl>
<dt>To add or remove the toolbar:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose File</b> from the menu bar.
<br>A checkmark beside Show Tool Bar indicates that the toolbar is present on the screen.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Show Tool Bar.</b>
<br>The Show Tool Bar state will be toggled.&nbsp; If the toolbar was on the screen, it will disappear.&nbsp; If the toolbar
 was not on the screen, it will reappear.
</dl>
<h3 id="Show_Status_Bar"> Show Status Bar </h3>
<br>The Integrated Development Environment Status Bar that appears at the bottom of the IDE window can be removed from or
 added to the screen.
<dl>
<dt>To add or remove the status bar:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose File</b> from the menu bar.
<br>A checkmark beside Show Status Bar indicates that the status bar is present on the screen.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Show Status Bar.</b>
<br>The Show Status Bar state will be toggled.&nbsp; If the status bar was on the screen, it will disappear.&nbsp; If the
 status bar was not on the screen, it will reappear.
</dl>
<h3 id="Auto_Refresh"> Auto Refresh </h3>
<br>The IDE will automatically update the target windows with the state of all files when this option is enabled.
<dl>
<dt>To enable or disable auto refresh:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose File</b> from the menu bar.
<br>A checkmark beside Auto Refresh indicates that auto refresh is enabled.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select Auto Refresh.</b>
<br>The Auto Refresh state will be toggled.&nbsp; When Auto Refresh is disabled, it may be necessary to select Refresh from
 the Window menu whenever the target window status becomes out of date.
</dl>
<h3 id="Selecting_Your_Own_Text_Editor"> Selecting Your Own Text Editor </h3>
<br>You can use your own favourite text editor from within the Integrated Development Environment.
<dl>
<dt>To select your own text editor:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Text Editor</b> from the File menu.
<br>The Set Text Editor dialog appears.&nbsp; You can enter the name of the text editor in the first field.&nbsp; You must
 also indicate whether the text editor is an executable file or a Dynamic Link Library (DLL).&nbsp; If the editor is an executable
 file (rather than a DLL), then you can enter an argument line in the second field.&nbsp; The argument line will be supplied
 to the editor whenever it is started by the IDE.&nbsp; The argument line can include any of three different macros which
 will be filled in by the IDE.&nbsp; The macros are:
<dl>
<dt>%f
<dd>The name of the file to be edited.
<dt><br>%r
<dd>The row in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a line number then the row value is extracted from the message; otherwise the row value is 1.
<dt><br>%c
<dd>The column in the file at which to position the cursor.&nbsp; If the editor is invoked from a diagnostic message which contains
 a column number then the column value is extracted from the message; otherwise the column value is 1.
</dl>
<br>For example, if the editor argument line that you specified was:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='%f' row='%r' col='%c'</tt>
<br><br>and you double click on an error message in the Log window that names the file<tt> foobar.c</tt> with an error at
 line 215 and column 31, then the argument line that is passed to your editor is:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file='foobar.c' row='215' col='31'</tt>
<br><br>This flexibility allows you to specify the name of the file to edit and the row and/or column at which to position
 the text cursor.&nbsp; If no row or column is available, then the IDE will supply the value of 1 as a default.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Select OK</b> when you wish to confirm the selection of a new editor.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select Cancel</b> when you wish to cancel the selection of a new editor.
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select Default</b> when you wish to restore the default editor selection and then select OK or Cancel.
</dl>
<h3 id="Selecting_a_Source_Revision_Control_System"> Selecting a Source Revision Control System </h3>
<br>You can use a source code Revision Control System (RCS) in conjunction with the Integrated Development Environment.
<dl>
<dt>To select a revision control system
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Set Source Control</b> from the File menu.
<br>A number of options are presented:
<dl>

<li>full source file path specification
<li>full message file path specification (this file contains the textual message that you enter when checking in a file)
<li>full project file path specification (.wpj file)
<li>full target file path specification (.tgt file)
</ol>
<h2 id="Executing_Special_Commands"> Executing Special Commands </h2>
<br>Sometimes you may find it necessary to execute commands before and/or after performing a make.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Integrated
 Development Environment provides Before and After commands in the File and Targets menus.&nbsp; These commands enable you
 to perform actions immediately before or after making either the selected target or all targets for the current project.
<dl>
<dt>To set Before or After directives:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Click once on the target</b> for which you want to set a before or after directive.
<br>The title bar of the selected target is highlighted.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Choose Target Options</b> from the Targets menu.
<br>A submenu appears from the Target Options menu.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Execute Before or Execute After</b> from the Target Options submenu.
<br>A Target Before or Target After dialog appears on your screen.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If you want to set before or after directives to be executed when you make all targets, select the before and after commands
 from the File menu.
</dl>
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Enter the command</b> you want to execute before or after the selected target is made.
<br><tt><img src="ide29.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 29.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Enter execute commands in the Target Before or Target After dialogs.</b>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to continue.
<br>The IDE stores the information you entered and closes the dialog.&nbsp; When you next perform a make on the selected target,
 the IDE will execute the before or after directive you entered.
</dl>
<h2 id="Adding_Resources_to_a_Target"> Adding Resources to a Target </h2>
<br>You may want to include resources in your target executable.&nbsp; There are two ways of doing this in the IDE:&nbsp;
 indirectly and directly.&nbsp; The act of adding resources to a target can only be done for targets that support resources,
 such as Windows or OS/2 PM.
<dl>
<dt>To add a resource to a target using the indirect method:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Create a new source file</b> with the extension &quot;.rc&quot;.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Edit Text</b> from the Sources menu to invoke the Open Watcom Editor.
<br>The editor opens on your screen with an empty window.&nbsp; You can now add the resource file text.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Enter the resource statements</b> in the editor.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Save your work and close the editor</b> when you are finished.
<br>You return to the Open Watcom IDE Project window.&nbsp; You can now compile the new source file.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<br>The selected source file is highlighted in the target window.
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Choose Make</b> from the Sources menu to compile the new source file.
<br>The IDE compiles the selected source file.&nbsp; To do this, the IDE invokes the Resource Compiler which creates a &quot;.res&quot;
 file.&nbsp; The &quot;.res&quot; file will be automatically included in the target when it is linked.
</dl>
<br>When you create the resource file directly, the source file contains the same information but it is stored in a different
 format.
<dl>
<dt>To add a resource to a target using the direct method:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Create a new source file</b> with the extension &quot;.res&quot;.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Choose Edit Resources</b> from the Sources menu to invoke the Open Watcom Resource Editor.
<br>The editor opens on your screen with an empty window.&nbsp; You can now create the resources.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Create the resources.</b>
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Save your work and close the editor</b> when you are finished.
<br>You return to the Open Watcom IDE Project window.&nbsp; You can now compile the new source file.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Click once on the new source file</b> to select it.
<br>The selected source file is highlighted in the target window.
<dt><br>(7)
<dd><b> Choose Make</b> from the Sources menu to compile the new source file.
<br>The IDE compiles the selected source file.&nbsp; The IDE does not need to invoke the Resource Compiler to create a &quot;.res&quot;
 file because you created the &quot;.res&quot; file directly using the Resource Editor.&nbsp; The &quot;.res&quot; file will
 be automatically included in the target when it is linked.
</dl>
<h2 id="Including_Libraries_in_a_Target"> Including Libraries in a Target </h2>
<br>You use the same procedure to include static and DLL libraries in your target as you use to add any source file to a target.
&nbsp; The IDE includes the libraries when the target is linked.
<dl>
<dt>To create static and DLL libraries:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Create a new target</b> entering the library name in the Target Name field and choosing the appropriate image type.
<br>Clicking on OK on the New Target dialog closes the dialog and creates a new target with the specified name in the title
 bar.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Add the desired source files,</b> new or existing, to the library you have created.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If you want one of your other targets to use that library, you must enter the library as a source file for that target.&nbsp;
 When you enter the library as a source file you must give it the extension &quot;.lib&quot;, regardless of whether the library
 is a static or DLL library.&nbsp; For example, if your library is entitled Target A and you want your existing Target B to
 use that library, add Target A as a source file on Target B with the extension &quot;.lib&quot;.
</dl>
</dl>
<h2 id="Targets_and_Image_Types_Supported_by_the_IDE"> Targets and Image Types Supported by the IDE </h2>

<h2 id="Invoking_Other_Applications_from_the_IDE"> Invoking Other Applications from the IDE </h2>
<br>When using the Open Watcom Integrated Development Environment, there are several other applications you may want to use.
&nbsp; To save you the frustration of having to constantly exit the IDE and start up a new application, we have made it possible
 to invoke other applications from within the Integrated Development Environment.&nbsp; Following are the applications you
 can invoke from the IDE:
<ul>
<li>Browser
<li>Open Watcom Debugger
<li>Open Watcom Execution Sampler
<li>Open Watcom Execution Profiler
<li>Open Watcom Disassembler
<li>Open Watcom Editor (text editor)
<li>Open Watcom Resource Editor
<li>Open Watcom Zoom
<li>Open Watcom Heap Walker
<li>Spy
<li>DDE Spy
</ul>
<br>You invoke these applications by making a selection from the toolbar or various menus in the IDE.&nbsp; The Actions menu
 contains some of the applications.&nbsp; You can find others in the Targets and Sources menus.&nbsp; The menu options that
 appear vary, depending on the contents of the current project.&nbsp; The applications are available in the menu items only
 when appropriate.&nbsp; For example, if the currently selected target has no source files, no applications appear in the
 Sources menu.
<br><br><b><i>Hint:</i></b>&nbsp; An alternate way to view the contents of the Targets and Sources menu is to click the right
 mouse button while your cursor is positioned in the project window.&nbsp; If your cursor is positioned over a target, the
 Targets menu appears.&nbsp; If your cursor is positioned over a source file, the Sources menu appears.
<br><br>Refer to the appropriate sections in this manual for detailed information on using the various applications.
<h2 id="Invoking_DOS_Applications_from_the_IDE_under_OSD2"> Invoking DOS Applications from the IDE under OS/2 </h2>
<br>There are occasions where you may wish to change the default DOS or WIN-OS/2 settings when running a DOS/Windows application
 from the IDE.&nbsp; The mechanism which we provide is through the use of a special<b> IDE_DOS_SETTINGS</b> environment variable.
&nbsp; For example, to set the DPMI memory limit to 16 and to enable DOS BREAK, you can set the environment variable as follows:
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set ide_dos_settings=dpmi_memory_limit#16;dos_break#1</tt>
<br><br>Due to the command processor limitations, the &quot;#&quot; character is used in place of the &quot;=&quot;.&nbsp;
 The above command is equivalent to configuring a DOS session with DOS settings as follows:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
