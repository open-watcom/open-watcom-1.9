<h1 id="Introduction_to_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77"> Introduction to Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 </h1>
<br>Welcome to the Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 1.9 development system.&nbsp; Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 is an Open Source successor
 to commercial compilers previously marketed by Sybase, Powersoft and originally WATCOM International Corp.
<br><br>Version 1.9 of Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 is a professional, optimizing, multi-platform FORTRAN 77 compiler with a comprehensive
 suite of development tools for developing and debugging both 16-bit and 32-bit applications for DOS, extended DOS, Novell
 NLMs, 16-bit OS/2, 32-bit OS/2, Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me, Win32s, and Windows NT/2000/XP (Win32).
<br><br>You should read the entire contents of this booklet, as it contains information on new programs and modifications
 that have been made since the previous release.
<hr>
<br><b>Special NOTE to users of previous versions!&nbsp; See the section entitled</b> <a href="#Release_Notes_for_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77_1_9">Release Notes for Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 1.9</a><b>

<h2 id="What_is_in_version_1_9_of_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77_"> What is in version 1.9 of Open Watcom FORTRAN 77? </h2>
<br>Version 1.9 incorporates the features professional developers have been demanding:
<dl>
<dt>Open, Multi-target Integrated Development Environment
<dd>The IDE allows you to easily edit, compile, link, debug and build applications for 16-bit systems like DOS, OS/2 1.x, and
 Windows 3.x and 32-bit systems like extended DOS, Novell NLMs, OS/2, Windows 3.x (Win32s), Windows 95/98/Me, and Windows
 NT/2000/XP.&nbsp; Projects can be made up of multiple targets which permit a project to include EXEs and DLLs.&nbsp; The
 IDE produces makefiles for the project which can be viewed and edited with a text editor.&nbsp; The IDE is hosted under Windows
 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000/XP, and 32-bit OS/2.

<li>Microsoft Windows version 3.1 running in enhanced mode
<li>Microsoft Windows 95 or higher
<li>Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1 or higher
<li>IBM OS/2 2.1 or higher
</ul>
<h2 id="The_README_File"> The README File </h2>
<br>Before you install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77, you should read the contents of the &quot;README&quot; file which is stored
 in the root directory of the CD-ROM.&nbsp; It contains valuable, up-to-date information concerning this product.
<h2 id="Installing_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77"> Installing Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 </h2>
<br>The installation program in this version has been completely redesigned with several new &quot;smart&quot; features.&nbsp;
 If you have installed a previous version of Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 then you should install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 1.9 into
 the same path (except for the reason described in the following paragraph).&nbsp; It will examine a previous installation
 to determine what features were previously installed.&nbsp; It will use this information to establish default settings for
 the installation that you are about to attempt.&nbsp; Of course, you can add or remove features as you progress through the
 installation steps.
<br><br>If you are installing only one of the Open Watcom C/C++ or Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products and you have an older version
 of the other product, we do NOT recommend that you install the new product into the same directory as the old product.&nbsp;
 The Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products are compatible at the same version number.&nbsp; However, the Open
 Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 products are usually NOT compatible across different version numbers.&nbsp; If this
 is the case, care must be exercised when switching between use of the two products.&nbsp; Environment variables such as<b>
 PATH</b> and<b> WATCOM</b> must be modified and/or corrected.&nbsp; System files such as<tt> CONFIG.SYS</tt> and<tt> SYSTEM.INI</tt>
 must be modified and/or corrected.
<br><br>If you are installing both Open Watcom C/C++ 1.9 and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 1.9, we recommend that you install both
 products under the same directory.&nbsp; This will eliminate duplication of files and, as a result, reduce the total required
 disk space.&nbsp; The two products share the use of certain environment variables which point to the installation directory.
&nbsp; If separate installation directories are used, problems will arise.
<br><br>When you install Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 in the same directory, you should not deselect any options
 when running the second installation; otherwise the second product's install may remove files that were installed (and are
 required) by the first product's install.&nbsp; This isn't an issue if you only have one of Open Watcom C/C++ or Open Watcom
 FORTRAN 77.&nbsp; The problem is that Open Watcom C/C++ and Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 don't know about the installation options
 you have selected for each other's product.
<br><br>If you wish to create a backup of your previous version, please do so before installing Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 1.9.
<br><br>If you decide to install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 1.9 into a different directory than the previously installed version,
 you will have to manually edit system files (e.g., CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI) after the installation process is
 complete to remove the old version from various environment variables (e.g., PATH, DEVICE=).&nbsp; This is necessary since
 the path to the new version will appear after the path to the old version.&nbsp; To avoid this extra work, we recommend installing
 the new version into the same path as the old version.
<br><br>As an example, here are a few of the environment variables and &quot;RUN&quot; directives that are modified/added
 to the OS/2<tt> CONFIG.SYS</tt> file.&nbsp; You should make sure that all references to the older version of the software
 are removed.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIBPATH=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\DLL;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET PATH=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP;D:\WATCOM\BINW;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET HELP=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\HELP;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET BOOKSHELF=...;D:\WATCOM\BINP\HELP;...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET INCLUDE=...;D:\WATCOM\H\OS2;D:\WATCOM\H;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET WATCOM=D:\WATCOM</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET EDPATH=D:\WATCOM\EDDAT</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RUN=D:\WATCOM\BINP\NMPBIND.EXE</tt>
<br><br>You may wish to run Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 under more than one operating system on the same personal computer.&nbsp;
 For every operating system that you use, simply start up the operating system and run the corresponding install procedure.
<br><br>If you run the Windows 3.x installation procedure, you do not need to run the DOS installation procedure also.
<br><br>If you plan to use Win-OS/2 as a development platform under OS/2, you must run the Windows 3.1 install program (selecting
 Windows 3.1 host support).
<br><br>Place the CD-ROM disk in your CD-ROM drive.&nbsp; Select one of the following procedures depending on the host operating
 system that you are currently running.&nbsp; Below, substitute the CD-ROM drive specification for &quot;x:&quot;.
<dl>

</dl>
<h2 id="Incremental_Installation"> Incremental Installation </h2>
<br>You may wish to install Open Watcom FORTRAN 77, and subsequently install features that you omitted in the first install.
&nbsp; You can also remove features that you no longer wish to have installed.&nbsp; You can achieve this as follows:
<ol>
<li>Start the installation program.
<li>Select any new features that you wish to install.
<li>Deselect any features that you wish to remove.
<li>Re-run the installation program for each host operating system that you use.
</ol>
<h2 id="System_Configuration_File_Modifications"> System Configuration File Modifications </h2>
<br>The install program makes changes to your operating system startup files to allow Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 to run.&nbsp;
 We strongly recommend that you allow the install program to modify your system configuration files for you, but you may do
 it by hand.&nbsp; The changes required may be found in any of the following files which have been placed in the root of the
 installation directory:
<dl>
<dt>CONFIG.NEW
<dd>Changes required for<tt> CONFIG.SYS</tt> (DOS, Windows, Windows 95/98/Me, OS/2)
<dt><br>AUTOEXEC.NEW
<dd>Changes required for<tt> AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt> (DOS, Windows, Windows 95/98/Me, OS/2)
<dt><br>CHANGES.ENV
<dd>Changes required for the Windows NT/2000/XP environment
</dl>
<h2 id="Installation_Notes_for_Windows_3_x"> Installation Notes for Windows 3.x </h2>

<li>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) uses the IBM OS/2 Enhanced System Editor (EPM) for editing text files.&nbsp;
 You must ensure that EPM is installed in your OS/2 system if you are planning to use the IDE.&nbsp; You can selectively install
 the Enhanced Editor by running the OS/2 Setup and Installation program (Selective Install) and choosing &quot;Enhanced Editor&quot;
 from the &quot;Tools and Games&quot; detail page.
<li>On some systems with limited memory that use the UNDELETE feature of OS/2, compile times may be slow because OS/2 is saving
 copies of compiler temporary files.&nbsp; You may start the BATSERV process using the OS/2<tt> STARTUP.CMD</tt> file with<b>

<h1 id="HandsMon_Introduction_to_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77"> Hands-on Introduction to Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 </h1>
<br>Let's get started and introduce some of the tools that are in Open Watcom FORTRAN 77.&nbsp; The purpose of this chapter
 is to briefly test out the new graphical tools in Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 using an existing application.
<br><br>In this tutorial, we will take an existing set of FORTRAN 77 source files, create a project in our integrated development
 environment, and perform the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Add multiple targets
<li>Make a target
<li>Make all targets
<li>Execute the program
<li>Debug the program
<li>Correct errors
<li>Sample and profile the executable
<li>Save the project
<li>Terminate the session
</ul>
<h2 id="Outline"> Outline </h2>
<br>Open Watcom's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) manages the files and tools that a programmer uses when developing
 a project.&nbsp; This includes all the source files, include files, libraries, compiler(s), linkers, preprocessors, etc.
&nbsp; that one uses.
<br><br>The IDE has a graphical interface that makes it easy to visualize the make-up of a project.&nbsp; A single IDE session
 shows a project.&nbsp; If the project consists of a number of components, such as two executables and one library, these
 are each shown as target windows in the project window.&nbsp; Each target window shows the files that are needed to construct
 the target and is associated via its filename extension with a rule that describes the construction mechanism.&nbsp; For
 example, a filename with the extension &quot;.EXE&quot; may be associated with the rule for constructing 32-bit Windows executables,
 or a filename with the extension &quot;.LIB&quot; may be associated with the rule for constructing static libraries.&nbsp;
 Different projects can refer to the same target.&nbsp; If they do, the target is shared and can be manipulated via either
 project, with changes made through one affecting the other.
<br><br>The IDE itself is a collection of programs that manages the various files and tools used to create the target libraries
 and executables.&nbsp; It creates makefile(s) from the information in the target descriptions and invokes Open Watcom Make
 to construct the targets themselves.&nbsp; A configuration file contains built-in knowledge of the Open Watcom compilers,
 editors, Profiler, and Browser, as well as all their switches.
<h2 id="The_Open_Watcom_FORTRAN_77_Tutorial"> The Open Watcom FORTRAN 77 Tutorial </h2>
<br>This tutorial walks you through the creation and execution of a FORTRAN 77 program under Windows.&nbsp; This will give
 you an understanding of the basic concepts of the IDE and its components, and it will detail the steps involved in project
 development.&nbsp; The result of this tutorial is a three dimensional drawing of a kitchen which you can manipulate using
 either the menus or the icons on the toolbar.&nbsp; You can rotate and resize the drawing, as well as adjust the lighting
 and contrast.
<br><br>To begin, start the IDE.&nbsp; This is done by double-clicking on the &quot;IDE&quot; icon in the Open Watcom FORTRAN
 77 window.
<br><br>A status field at the bottom of the IDE window indicates the function of the icon on the toolbar over which your mouse
 cursor is currently positioned.&nbsp; If the status area does not show you the function of the icons as you move the mouse
 cursor over them, check that no item in the menu bar is highlighted (if one is highlighted, press the Alt key).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide1c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>

<h3 id="Defining_a_Project"> Defining a Project </h3>
<br>In this tutorial, you will be creating a new project called<tt> KITCHEN.</tt>&nbsp; Here are the steps required to accomplish
 this task.
<ol>
<li>Define a new project by pulling down the<b> File</b> menu and selecting the<b> New Project...</b>&nbsp; item.&nbsp; You
 can also define a new project by clicking on the &quot;Create a new project&quot; icon on the toolbar.
<li>A choice of different sample project directories is available.&nbsp; Assuming that you installed the Open Watcom FORTRAN
 77 software in the<tt> \WATCOM</tt> directory, you will find the sample project directories in the following directory:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \WATCOM\SAMPLES\IDE\FORTRAN</tt>
<br><br>For purposes of this tutorial, we recommend that you select one of the following project directories:
<dl>
<dt>WIN
<dd>for an example of 16-bit Windows 3.x application development when using Windows 3.x under DOS as a host development system,
<dt><br>WIN386
<dd>for an example of 32-bit Windows 3.x application development when using Windows 3.x under DOS as a host development system,
<dt><br>WIN32
<dd>for an example of 32-bit Win32 application development when using Windows NT/2000/XP or Windows 95/98/Me as a host development
 system, and
<dt><br>OS2
<dd>for an example of 32-bit OS/2 application development when using 32-bit OS/2 as a host development system.
</dl>
<br>Thus the<tt> target</tt> that we refer to below should be one of<tt> WIN, WIN386, WIN32,</tt> or<tt> OS2</tt> depending
 on your selection.&nbsp; The tutorial uses the<tt> WIN32</tt> example for illustrative purposes.&nbsp; You will find some
 minor variations from your selected target environment.
<br><br>When asked for a project name, you can do one of two things:
<ol>
<li>enter the following pathname:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d:&#91;path&#93;\SAMPLES\IDE\FORTRAN\target\KITCHEN</tt>
<br><br>where<tt> d:&#91;path&#93;</tt> is the drive and path where you installed the Open Watcom software, or
<li>use the file browser to select the following directory:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d:&#91;path&#93;\SAMPLES\IDE\FORTRAN\target</tt>
<br><br>and specify the filename<tt> kitchen.</tt>
</ol>
<br><tt><img src="ide2f.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 2.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Creating a new project</b>
<br><br>Press the Enter key or click on OK (OPEN).
<br><br>The project description will be stored in this file and the IDE will set the current working directory to the specified
 path during your session.
<li>You will be prompted for a target name.&nbsp; Since we will be attaching pre-defined targets, just click the<b> Browse</b>
 button when prompted for the target name.&nbsp; Select the &quot;draw&quot; target file (it will be one of<tt> draw16.tgt,
 draw.tgt, draw32.tgt, drawos2.tgt</tt> depending on your selection of target).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide3f.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 3.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Attaching existing targets</b>
<br><br>Press the Enter key or click on OK (OPEN).
<li>You can ignore the settings displayed for<b> Target Environment</b> and<b> Image Type</b> since the target definition
 already exists (we created it for you).&nbsp; The settings are important when you are defining a new target (i.e., one that
 was not predefined).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide4c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 4.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Selecting a target type</b>
<br><br>Press the Enter key or click on OK.
</ol>
<br>A target window is created in the project window for the &quot;draw&quot; target.&nbsp; This window contains all of the
 files associated with the target.&nbsp; You can click on any of the &quot;Folder&quot; icons to hide or un-hide all files
 with a particular extension.&nbsp; For example, you may wish to un-hide all the files with a<tt> .bmp</tt> extension by clicking
 on the folder icon associated with bitmap files.
<h3 id="Adding_Multiple_Targets"> Adding Multiple Targets </h3>
<br>Open Watcom's IDE allows you to have multiple targets in any particular project.&nbsp; Note that targets can be used by
 multiple projects.&nbsp; To add a new target to the project, do the following.
<ol>
<li>Pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu and select the<b> New Target...</b>&nbsp; item.
<li>Enter<tt> button.tgt</tt> as the target name for the new target to be added to the project.&nbsp; Do not forget to include
 the<tt> .tgt</tt> extension.&nbsp; It is required when selecting a pre-existing target.
<li>You can ignore the settings displayed for<b> Target Environment</b> and<b> Image Type</b> since the target definition
 already exists (we created it for you).&nbsp; The settings are important when you are defining a new target (i.e., one that
 was not predefined).
<li>Press the Enter key or click on OK.
</ol>
<br>A target window is created in the project window for the<tt> button</tt> target.
<h3 id="Making_a_Target"> Making a Target </h3>
<br>Open Watcom's IDE will automatically generate the sequence of steps required to build or &quot;make&quot; each of the
 targets in a project.&nbsp; Note that the targets in a project can be made individually or collectively.&nbsp; To make the<tt>
 button.lib</tt> target, do the following.
<ol>
<li>Click on the window of the target you wish to make.&nbsp; In this case, click on the<tt> button.lib</tt> target window.
<li>Pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu and select the<b> Make</b> item (you can also do this by clicking on the &quot;Make
 the current target&quot; icon on the toolbar, or by right-clicking on the target and selecting the<b> Make</b> item from
 the pop-up menu).
</ol>
<br>The IDE will now construct a makefile based on its knowledge of the target and construction rules, and then invoke the
 make utility to create the target, in this case<tt> button.lib.</tt>&nbsp; The output of this procedure is displayed in the
 Log window.
<h3 id="Making_All_Targets"> Making All Targets </h3>
<br>Click the &quot;Make all targets in the project&quot; icon on the toolbar to make all of the targets in the current project.
&nbsp; If one target depends on another target, the latter target will be made first.&nbsp; In this tutorial<tt> button.lib</tt>
 will be made first (there will be nothing to do since it was made previously) and then<tt> draw???.exe,</tt> since<tt> button.lib</tt>
 is in the list of files associated with<tt> draw???.exe.</tt>&nbsp; In each case, the IDE constructs makefiles based on its
 knowledge of the target and construction rules.&nbsp; The output of this procedure is displayed in the Log window.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide5f.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 5.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Making one or more targets</b>
<h3 id="Executing_the_Program"> Executing the Program </h3>
<br>The project should have built without errors, so now you are ready to execute the program you have developed.
<br><br>Click on the<tt> draw???.exe</tt> target window and simply click on the &quot;Run the current target&quot; icon on
 the toolbar.&nbsp; You can also do this by selecting<b> Run</b> from the<b> Targets</b> menu, or right-clicking anywhere
 on the target window outside of the inner frame and selecting<b> Run</b> from the pop-up menu (right-clicking is context
 sensitive and the pop-up menu that results will vary depending on the area of the window in which you right-click).
<br><br><tt><img src="ide6c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 6.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The kitchen demo</b>
<br><br>The demo you have created is a simple three dimensional drawing of a kitchen.&nbsp; By using either the icons on the
 toolbar or the menus you can rotate the picture left, right, up, and down, make the picture brighter or dimmer, move the
 picture closer or farther away, and increase or decrease the amount of contrast (this latter feature is found in the &quot;Lighting&quot;
 menu).&nbsp; Choose<b> Exit</b> from the<b> File</b> menu to exit the demo program when you are finished.
<h3 id="Smart_Editing"> Smart Editing </h3>
<br>The IDE recognizes the type of file you wish to edit, and invokes the appropriate editor for the task.&nbsp; To edit a
 file, you either double-click on it or select it and click the &quot;Edit&quot; icon on the toolbar.&nbsp; Files with a<tt>
 .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .for, .asm</tt> or<tt> .rc</tt> extension are edited with a text editor; files with a<tt> .bmp, .ico,</tt>
 or<tt> .cur</tt> extension are edited with the Image Editor; files with a<tt> .dlg</tt> or<tt> .res</tt> extension are edited
 with the Resource Editor.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide7f.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 7.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Editor for Windows</b>
<br><br>Now we will edit one of the source files and introduce an error into the application.
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the &quot;draw&quot; source file (i.e.,<tt> draw???.for</tt>) to load the source file into the editor.
<li>Search for the line containing the text:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c$ifdef undefined</tt>
<br><br>For Windows users, &quot;Find&quot; is in the &quot;Edit&quot; menu.&nbsp; If you are building a WIN386 application,
 search for the second line containing this text (located in subroutine<tt> memclear</tt>).
<li>Now, to introduce an error into the application, add the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c$define undefined</tt>
<br><br>just before the line containing<tt> c$ifdef.</tt>
<li>Save your changes by clicking on the &quot;Write the current file to disk&quot; icon or select<b> Save</b> from the<b>
 File</b> menu.
<li>Return to the IDE (by clicking on it if it is visible on your screen, or by using Alt-Tab), re-make your project, and
 run it.&nbsp; A fault occurs in your application, so the next step is to track down the problem using the Open Watcom Debugger.
</ol>
<h3 id="Debugging_the_Program"> Debugging the Program </h3>
<br>To debug a program it must first be compiled to include debugging information.&nbsp; The IDE maintains two sets of switches
 for each target in a project.&nbsp; These are known as the Development Switches and the Release Switches.
<ol>
<li>Right click on<tt> draw???.for</tt> and select<b> Source options</b> from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; Select<b> Fortran Compiler
 Switches</b> from the sub-menu.
<br><br>By default, your target is placed in development mode with the debugging switches for the compiler and linker set
 to include debugging information.&nbsp; You can either set the switches in each category manually or you can copy the default
 Release switches using the CopyRel button.&nbsp; This method of setting switches is especially convenient since you can specify
 everything from diagnostic, optimization, and code generation switches to special linker switches all without having to memorize
 a cryptic switch name - you simply click next to the switches you wish to use for a particular item.
<li>Scroll through the categories using the &gt;&gt; button until you get to:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Debugging Switches</tt>
<br><br>We can see that full debugging information was used in the compile, so just click on<b> Cancel</b> to exit this screen.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide8f.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 8.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Setting compiler switches</b>
<li>To invoke the debugger, pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu and choose the<b> Debug</b> item or select the &quot;Debug the
 current target&quot; icon from the toolbar.
</ol>
<br>The Open Watcom Debugger is designed to be as convenient and intuitive as possible, while at the same time providing a
 comprehensive and flexible environment for serious debugging.&nbsp; You can configure your environment to display exactly
 the information you require to be most productive.&nbsp; Among the windows available are source and assembly, modules, functions,
 calls, threads, images, watches, locals, globals, file variables, registers, 80x87 FPU, stack, I/O ports, memory display,
 and a log window.&nbsp; You can step through your source using the keys or icons on the toolbar.&nbsp; Execute one line at
 a time by stepping over calls or stepping into calls, or execute until the current function returns.&nbsp; Right-mouse button
 functionality gives context-sensitive pop-up menus.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide9f.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 9.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Debugger</b>
<br><br>We know that a fault has occurred in<tt> draw???.exe,</tt> so we will run the application and examine the state of
 the program when the fault occurs.
<ol>
<li>Click on the &quot;go!&quot; icon on the toolbar to begin execution of the program.&nbsp; The exception occurs and the
 source window shows the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arr( cnt ) = ch</tt>
<br><br>in the subroutine<tt> memclear</tt> as the last line executed before the exception.&nbsp; Examining the Locals window
 you will see that the array location or address,<tt> locale,</tt> is 0.&nbsp; This means that the array<tt> arr</tt> was
 mapped to location 0.&nbsp; For the 32-bit Windows example, we also needed to use the &quot;array&quot; pragma to force a
 far pointer reference to cause the exception.
<li>We can now move up the call stack by clicking on the &quot;Move up the call stack&quot; icon on the toolbar (red up arrow)
 to follow the program's execution.&nbsp; On the previous executable line of code, we see<tt> memclear</tt> is called from
 the main program with three arguments.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call memclear( 0, loc(Draw_area), isizeof(RECTL) )</tt>
<br><br>We see that<tt> memclear</tt> is called with 0 as the first argument and<tt> loc(Draw_area)</tt> as the second argument
 which is backwards to the way it should be.&nbsp; An artificial error was introduced for the purposes of this tutorial.
<li>By removing the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c$define undefined</tt>
<br><br>we can undo this error.&nbsp; Exit the debugger.
<li>Double-click on<tt> draw???.for</tt> to load the source file into the editor.
<li>Go to the line in question using &quot;find&quot; or &quot;search&quot; and delete the line.&nbsp; Save your changes by
 clicking on the &quot;Write the current file to disk&quot; icon or selecting<b> Save</b> from the<b> File</b> menu.
<li>Return to the IDE (by clicking on it if it is visible on your screen, or by using Alt-Tab) and re-make your project.
<li>Run your project to see the kitchen demo.
</ol>
<h3 id="Correcting_an_Error"> Correcting an Error </h3>
<br>We are now going to introduce an error into the source code to illustrate another feature of the IDE.
<ol>
<li>Double-click on<tt> draw???.for</tt> to load the source file into the editor.
<li>Search for the line containing the text:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c$ifdef undefined</tt>
<br><br>For Windows users, &quot;Find&quot; is in the &quot;Edit&quot; menu.
<li>Now, to introduce a syntax error into the application, add the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hThree_d + 0</tt>
<br><br>just before the line containing<tt> c$ifdef.</tt>
<li>Save your changes by clicking on the &quot;Write the current file to disk&quot; icon or select<b> Save</b> from the<b>
 File</b> menu.
<li>Return to the IDE (by clicking on it if it is visible on your screen, or by using Alt-Tab).
<li>Click the &quot;Make all targets in the project&quot; icon to re-make the project.
</ol>
<br>An error is encountered during the make and error message(s) appear in the log window.&nbsp; Additional information on
 the error is available by selecting the error, pulling down the<b> Log</b> menu and selecting the<b> Help on Message</b>
 item.
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the error message
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawwin.for(83): *ERR* ST-17 column 9, undecodeable statement or</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; misspelled word HTHREE_D</tt>
<br><br>The offending source file (<tt> draw???.for</tt>) is loaded into the Editor and the cursor is positioned at the line
 which caused the error.
<li>Delete the line to correct the error.
<li>Save your changes.
<li>Return to the IDE and re-make the project.
</ol>
<h3 id="Editing_a_Bitmap"> Editing a Bitmap </h3>
<br>You can edit bitmaps, icons, or cursors associated with your project using Open Watcom's Image Editor.&nbsp; Double-click
 on a file with a<tt> .bmp, .ico,</tt> or<tt> .cur</tt> extension and the file is loaded into the Image Editor.&nbsp; The
 editor has many features to design your images, including resizing, rotation, shifting, and a utility to take a &quot;snapshot&quot;
 of another image and import it.
<br><br><tt><img src="ide11c.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 10.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom Image Editor</b>

<br>Together, the Open Watcom Execution Sampler and the Open Watcom Execution Profiler allow you to pinpoint the areas of
 your code that are the most heavily used, indicating possible candidates for performance improvements.
<ol>
<li>Click on the<tt> draw???.exe</tt> target.
<li>Select the<b> Sample</b> item from the<b> Targets</b> menu item, or click on the &quot;Run and sample the current target&quot;
 icon from the toolbar.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Execution Sampler is invoked and your application begins to execute.
<li>Try rotating and resizing the image a few times.&nbsp; The sampler takes a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the code that is being
 executed at regular intervals.&nbsp; Exit the application.&nbsp; A samples file with extension<tt> .smp</tt> is created in
 the current directory.&nbsp; This file is input for the profiler.
<li>You are now ready to profile the executable.&nbsp; Do this by selecting<b> Profile</b> from the<b> Targets</b> menu, or
 by clicking on the &quot;Profile the current target&quot; icon on the toolbar.&nbsp; The profiler scans the<tt> .smp</tt>
 file and reports the activity in the various modules of the application.&nbsp; The percentage of time spent in the modules
 is indicated as an absolute percentage (percent of total samples) and as a relative percentage (percent of samples in the<tt>
 .exe</tt> image).
<li>Double-click on the module or routine names to step down to the exact source being executed when a sample was taken.&nbsp;
 For more details, you can adjust the sampling rate of the Sampler to get a better picture of your code.&nbsp; To do this,
 exit the Profiler, pull down the<b> Targets</b> menu, and select<b> Target options,</b> then<b> Sample Switches...</b>&nbsp;
 from the pop-up menus.&nbsp; Specify a sampling rate such as 2 (for 2 milliseconds), click on OK, then run the Sampler and
 Profiler again.

<h2 id="Tutorial_Review"> Tutorial Review </h2>
<br>In this tutorial, you created a project called<tt> kitchen.wpj,</tt> which was composed of two targets:<tt>&nbsp; draw???.exe</tt>
 and<tt> button.lib.</tt>&nbsp; You compiled and linked it into an executable program using the WMAKE utility, the Open Watcom
 FORTRAN 77 compiler, and the Open Watcom Linker.&nbsp; You executed it both directly and under the control of the Open Watcom
 Debugger..&nbsp; You browsed the source, and made changes using the text and resource editors.&nbsp; Finally, you sampled
 and profiled the application.
<br><br>When you saved the project, you created the following permanent files:
<ul>
<li><tt> kitchen.wpj</tt> - describes the screen layout and refers to the target files called<tt> draw???.tgt</tt> and<tt>
 button.tgt.</tt>
<li><tt> draw???.tgt</tt> - describes the target executable<tt> draw???.exe</tt> and all switches required to link it.&nbsp;
 It also describes the<tt> .for</tt> files and switches required to compile them.
<li><tt> button.tgt</tt> - describes the target library and all switches required to create it.&nbsp; It also describes the<tt>
 .for</tt> file and the switches used to build the library.

</ul>
<h3 id="Changes_to_the_Code_Generator_for_11_0"> Changes to the Code Generator for 11.0 </h3>
<ul>
<li>A new optimization, &quot;branch prediction&quot;, has been added.&nbsp; This optimization is enabled by the &quot;OBP&quot;
 or &quot;OX&quot; compiler options.&nbsp; The code generator tries to increase the density of cache use by predicting branches
 based upon heuristics (this optimization is especially important for Intel's Pentium Pro).
<li>We have added Multi-media Extensions (MMX) support to the in-line assembler.
</ul>
<h3 id="Changes_to_the_Compiler_Tools_for_11_0"> Changes to the Compiler Tools for 11.0 </h3>
<ul>
<li>The Open Watcom Linker supports incremental linking.

 can now read both AR-format (Microsoft compatible) libraries and old-style OMF libraries.
<li>Support for creating 16-bit DOS overlaid executables has been removed from the linker.
<li>The Open Watcom Library Manager (WLIB) can now process COFF and ELF format object files, as well as OMF et al.&nbsp; The
 Open Watcom Library Manager can now read/write both AR-format (Microsoft compatible) libraries and old-style OMF libraries.
&nbsp; The default output format is AR-format and this can be changed by switches.&nbsp; The Open Watcom Library Manager can
 output various format import libraries.
<li>We have added Multi-media Extensions (MMX) support to the Open Watcom Assembler (WASM).
<li>A new version of the Open Watcom Disassembler (WDIS) is included.&nbsp; It can process ELF, COFF or OMF object files and
 ELF, COFF or PE format (Win32) executables.
<br><br>The old disassembler (WDISASM) has been retired and is not included in the package.
<li>We have added new tool front-ends that emulate Microsoft tools.&nbsp; These are:
<ul>
<li>rc
</ul>
<br>These programs take the usual Microsoft arguments and translate them, where possible, into equivalent Open Watcom arguments
 and spawn the equivalent Open Watcom tools.
<li>Open Watcom Make now processes Microsoft format makefiles when the &quot;ms&quot; option is used.
</ul>
<h3 id="Changes_to_the_CDCPP_Libraries_for_11_0"> Changes to the C/C++ Libraries for 11.0 </h3>
<ul>
<li>We have added multi-byte and wide character (including UNICODE) support to the libraries.

<dt>_diskfree_t
<dd>The struct members of the _diskfree_t structure has been changed from UNSIGNED SHORTs to UNSIGNED INTs.&nbsp; This is to deal
 with possible HPFS partitions whose size will overflow a short, as well as Microsoft compatibility.
<dt><br>clock()
<dd>The<b><i> clock</i></b> function accuracy has changed from 100 ticks per second to 1000 ticks per second (i.e.,<b><i> CLOCKS_PER_SEC</i></b>
 has changed).&nbsp; Source code that uses the<b><i> clock</i></b> function and<b><i> CLOCKS_PER_SEC</i></b> in its calculations

<br>FORTRAN applications should not require recompilation, but<b> you should recompile your application if you want to take
 full advantage new features in the debugger.</b>
<h2 id="Major_Differences_from_Version_9_0"> Major Differences from Version 9.0 </h2>
<br>The following lists some of the new features/differences between version 9.5 and 9.0.
<ol>
<li>The &quot;/resource&quot; option has been added and allows run-time messages to be placed in the executable file as resource
 information instead of being linked with the application.&nbsp; The resource file containing these messages is called &quot;wf77.res&quot;
 and is locating in the root of the directory in which you installed the software.&nbsp; The strip utility (WSTRIP) can be
 used to place the resource information in the executable file.&nbsp; Special libraries for processing resource information
 will be required when you link your application.&nbsp; These libraries are called &quot;wresf.lib&quot; (for 32-bit register
 calling convention), &quot;wresfs.lib&quot; (for 32-bit stack calling convention), &quot;wresm.lib&quot; (for 16-bit medium
 memory model), and &quot;wresl.lib&quot; (for 16-bit large and huge memory models) and are located in the &quot;lib386&quot;
 and &quot;lib286&quot; directories of the directory in which you installed the software.
<li>The &quot;/5&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate code that is optimized for the Pentium.&nbsp;
 This is the default.&nbsp; The &quot;/fp5&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate floating-point
 code that is optimized for the Pentium.&nbsp; This is not the default.&nbsp; The default floating-point option is &quot;/fp3&quot;.
<li>The &quot;/3&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate code optimized for a 80386 processor.&nbsp;
 The &quot;/4&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate code optimized for a 80486 processor.&nbsp;
 The &quot;/5&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate code that is optimized for the Pentium.&nbsp;
 In addition, the &quot;/fp5&quot; option has been added and causes the compiler to generate floating-point code that is optimized
 for the Pentium.
<li>The &quot;/descriptor&quot; option has been added which specifies that string descriptors are to be passed for character
 arguments.&nbsp; You can specify the &quot;/nodescriptor&quot; option if you do not want string descriptors to be passed
 for character arguments.&nbsp; Instead, the pointer to the actual character data and the length will be passed as two arguments.
&nbsp; The arguments for the length will be passed as additional arguments following the normal argument list.&nbsp; For character
 functions, the pointer to the data and the length of the character function will be passed as the first two arguments.
<li>The &quot;oi&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; This option causes code for statement functions to be generated in-line.
<li>The floating-point model used when generating in-line 80x87 instructions has changed.&nbsp; If you wish to call subprograms
 compiled with version 9.0 you must specify the &quot;/fpr&quot; option.
<li>Support for records in text files separated by only a line feed character has been added.&nbsp; Previously, records in
 text files had to be separated by a carriage return/line feed sequence.
<li>The &quot;/debug&quot; option has been divided into two separate options.&nbsp; The &quot;/bounds&quot; option generates
 array and character subscript checking code.&nbsp; The &quot;/trace&quot; option generates code that allows a run-time traceback
 to be generated when a error is issued.
<li>The &quot;/quiet&quot; option has been added to suppress banner/summary information.&nbsp; The &quot;terminal&quot; option
 only affects the display of diagnostic messages (extensions, warnings and errors).&nbsp; For example, compiling with the
 &quot;/quiet&quot; option will only display diagnostic messages (if any).
<li>The &quot;/cc&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; It specifies that unit 6 is a carriage control device and that output
 to this unit will be assumed to contain carriage control characters.&nbsp; Note that a blank carriage control character will
 automatically be generated for list-directed output.
<li>The &quot;/automatic&quot; option causes all local variables (including arrays) to be allocated on the stack.&nbsp; Care
 should be taken when using this option since the stack requirements of your application may increase dramatically.
<li>The &quot;/wild&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; It suppresses the compile-time checking that normally causes an error
 to be issued when an attempt is made to transfer control into a block structure from outside the block structure and vice
 versa.&nbsp; This option is only to be used when compiling existing code that contains GOTO statements of this type; it does
 not encourage this style of programming.
<li>National language support has been added.&nbsp; The &quot;/japanese&quot; option causes the compiler to process Japanese
 double-byte characters in variable names and character data.&nbsp; Similarly, the &quot;/chinese&quot; option will process
 Traditional Chinese characters and the &quot;/korean&quot; will process Korean characters.
<li>The &quot;/ob&quot; option has been added.&nbsp; This allows the code generator to use register ESP as a base register
 to reference local variables and subprogram arguments.&nbsp; Note that when this option is specified, the compiler will abort
 when there is not enough memory to optimize the subprogram.&nbsp; By default, the code generator uses more memory-efficient
 algorithms when a low-on-memory condition is detected.
<li>The GROWHANDLES() function has be added.&nbsp; This function increases the number of files that can be opened by a program
 to the specified amount.&nbsp; The value returned is the new maximum.&nbsp; This may be less than the requested amount because
 of operating system limitations.
<li>The IARGC() and IGETARG() functions have been added.&nbsp; IARGC is an integer function that returns the argument count.
&nbsp; IGETARG is an integer function that takes two arguments.&nbsp; The first argument is of type INTEGER and is the index
 of the argument to be returned.&nbsp; The second argument is of type CHARACTER and is used to return the argument.&nbsp;
 The value returned by the function is the length of the argument.
<li>The SHARE= specifier has been added to the OPEN statement.&nbsp; It allows the program to specify how other processes
 can access a file that is opened by the original process.&nbsp; Possible values for the SHARE= specifier are as follows.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYRW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - deny read and write access
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYWR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - deny write access
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYRD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - deny read access
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DENYNO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - allow read and write access
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - compatibility mode

<h1 id="TroubleMShooting"> Trouble-Shooting </h1>
<br>This section is intended to provide you with help on some of the common (and not so common) problems that users have encountered
 when trying to run the software.
<dl>
<dt>Symptom:
<dd>The message &quot;Cannot connect to batch spawn server&quot; is displayed.
<dt><br>Resolution:
<dd>This message occurs when the Open Watcom IDE is trying to connect to the batch server.&nbsp; The batch server is a program
 that is employed by the Open Watcom IDE to run &quot;makes&quot; in the background.&nbsp; There are several reasons why you
 may receive this message.
<ul>
<li><b> Installing Under the Host System and Selecting &quot;Modify System Files&quot; During Install</b>
<br><br>For the IDE to run properly under a particular host operating system, the install program must be run on that system.
<br><br>It is very important to check the &quot;Modify System Files&quot; when running the install on the host platform.&nbsp;
 Otherwise, changes required in the host system's environment will not be made.&nbsp; If this is the problem, you should re-install
 under the host environment and select this option.
<li><b> System stability</b>
<br><br>If for some reason the operating system has become unstable, the IDE may have trouble connecting to the batch server.
&nbsp; This can happen if you have run a badly behaved application that caused an exception, for example a page fault.&nbsp;
 If this is the problem, you should shutdown the operating system and reboot.
<li><b> Running Windows 3.1 in Enhanced Mode</b>
<br><br>The IDE requires at least version 3.1 of Windows to be running, in enhanced mode.&nbsp; Windows 3.0 is not supported.
</ul>
</dl>
<br><b>Running Third-Party Shell Programs</b>
<br><br>If you run 4DOS.COM or some other shell besides COMMAND.COM, you must change the &quot;BATCHBOX.PIF&quot; file accordingly.
&nbsp; You can do this using the standard Windows PIF editor.
<br><br><b>Running Virus Checkers</b>
<br><br>If you are running Central Point's PCTOOLS, VWATCH, or some other virus checker, it may be conflicting with our batch
 server.&nbsp; To isolate the problem, uninstall the virus checker and see if the IDE works again.
<br><br><b>386 Enhanced &quot;Exclusive in Foreground&quot; Option</b>
<br><br>If you go to the Windows Control Panel, &quot;Scheduling Options&quot; of &quot;386 Enhanced&quot;, and the &quot;Exclusive
 in Foreground&quot; checkbox is checked, uncheck it.&nbsp; This causes our batch server to starve under Windows.
<br><br><b>Changes to the SYSTEM.INI File</b>
<br><br>The WDEBUG.386 driver is required to be installed in the &#91;386Enh&#93; section of SYSTEM.INI.&nbsp; This should
 have been done automatically by the WATCOM install program when the software was installed under the host environment and
 the &quot;modify system files&quot; option was selected.
<br><br>It has been reported that the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OverlappedIO=on</tt>
<br><br>not appear in the SYSTEM.INI file.
<br><br>It appears the user's problem was related to conflicts with other devices installed in the SYSTEM.INI file.&nbsp;
 On its own, the above line does not appear to affect the execution of the IDE.
<br><br>It has been reported that the line
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NoEMMDriver=ON</tt>
<br><br>not appear in the SYSTEM.INI file.&nbsp; It will prevent a link from succeeding in the IDE.
<h2 id="WinMOSD2_and_OSD2_Specific"> Win-OS/2 and OS/2 Specific </h2>
<br><b>Installing for a Win-OS/2 Host</b>
<br><br>For Win-OS/2, the install must be run under OS/2 and &quot;Modify System Files&quot; must be selected.&nbsp; This
 installs the batch server under OS/2, which we require under Win-OS/2.&nbsp; Then the Windows install program should be run
 under Win-OS/2 so that the program groups will be created.&nbsp; &quot;Modify System Files&quot; should also be checked for
 the Win-OS/2 install.
<br><br><b>Named Pipe Conflicts</b>
<br><br>Under OS/2, the batch server is a named pipe.&nbsp; Win-OS/2 uses the OS/2 named pipe for the batch server, hence
 the OS/2 IDE will conflict with the Win-OS/2 IDE if they are both running.&nbsp; If this is the problem, you should run only
 one of the OS/2 and Win-OS/2 IDE, not both at the same time.
