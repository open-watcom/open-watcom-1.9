<h1 id="Zoom"> Zoom </h1>
<br>Zoom is a tool designed to magnify selected sections of your screen.&nbsp; This allows you to view icons more closely
 and examine windows to detect errors in the graphics.&nbsp; With Zoom you can also watch a program, while magnified, paint
 its windows to detect subtle errors.
<h2 id="Using_Zoom"> Using Zoom </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Starting Zoom
<li>Quitting Zoom
<li>The Zoom Menu Bar
<li>The Zoom Window
</ul>
<h3 id="Starting_Zoom"> Starting Zoom </h3>
<br>To start Zoom double-click on the Zoom icon.&nbsp; This opens the Open Watcom Zoom window.&nbsp; When you start Zoom,
 the Zoom window contains a magnification of the upper left hand corner of the current screen.
<br><br><tt><img src="wzm1.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 1.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Zoom window displays, in magnification, the selected screen area.</b>
<h3 id="Quitting_Zoom"> Quitting Zoom </h3>
<br>To close the Zoom session, choose Exit from the File menu of the Open Watcom Zoom window.
<h3 id="The_Zoom_Menu_Bar"> The Zoom Menu Bar </h3>
<br>The menu bar consists of the following:
<dl>
<dt>File
<dd>Configure the session and paste the window contents to the clipboard
<dt><br>&lt;&lt;
<dd>Decrease the magnification of the object in the Zoom window
<dt><br>&gt;&gt;
<dd>Increase the magnification of the object in the Zoom window
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Zoom_Window"> The Zoom Window </h3>
<br>The Open Watcom Zoom Window has both a vertical and horizontal scroll bar which enable you to view, in magnification,
 the area around the selected screen space.&nbsp; Once you have selected an area to view in magnification, you can decrease
 and increase the magnification using the symbols on the menu bar.
<ul>
<li>Click on the decrease symbol (&lt;&lt;) to lessen the magnification of the selected area.
<li>Click on the increase symbol (&gt;&gt;) to get a closer view of the selected area.
</ul>
<h2 id="Zoom_Operations"> Zoom Operations </h2>
<br>There are a number of functions you can perform with Zoom, including zooming, resizing the window, and pasting magnified
 screen sections to the clipboard.&nbsp; This section describes each Zoom function.
<h3 id="Zooming"> Zooming </h3>
<br>The following procedures describe the standard steps you perform to zoom.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Position the mouse pointer in the Zoom window.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</b> outside of the Zoom window.
<br>Attached to the cursor is a box which acts as a magnifier.&nbsp; As you move the mouse, the screen sections over which
 you drag this magnifier appear magnified in the Zoom window.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Position the magnifier on top of the screen area</b> you want to capture in magnification.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Release the mouse button.</b>
<br>Zoom captures the selected screen section in the Zoom window in magnification.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Make fine adjustments,</b> such as centering the captured image, using the scroll bars of the Zoom window.
<br>Scrolling is a standard Windows feature.&nbsp; However, with Zoom, you can see the magnifier move on the screen as you
 scroll the captured image in the Zoom window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Resizing_the_Zoom_Window"> Resizing the Zoom Window </h3>
<br>Resizing the Zoom window can be done at two different times:&nbsp; before you zoom an area or while you are zooming an
 area.
<br><br>Resizing the window before you zoom is a standard Windows operation.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Position the cursor on the border of the window</b> until it turns into a double-pointed arrow.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</b> until the window is the desired size.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Release the mouse button.</b>
</dl>
<br>While positioning the magnifier over an area of the screen to select it for magnification, you may find you want to increase
 or decrease the size of the area you capture.
<dl>
<dt>To resize the window while zooming:
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Position the cursor in the Zoom window.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse</b> outside of the Zoom window.
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Position the magnifier</b> over the desired screen area to select.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Press the right mouse button</b> while continuing to hold down the left mouse button.
<br>If the Sticky Magnifier option is activated, you do not need to hold down the left mouse button.&nbsp; For details on
 the Sticky Magnifier option, refer to the section entitled <a href="#Configuring_Zoom">Configuring Zoom</a>.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Move the mouse to increase or decrease the size</b> of the magnifier.
<br>There is a maximum and minimum size for the magnifier.&nbsp; The resizing interaction is similar to resizing a regular
 window.&nbsp; The Zoom window does not change in size until you release the right mouse button.
<dt><br>(6)
<dd><b> Release the right mouse button</b> when the magnifier is the desired size.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>When resizing the window while zooming, the Zoom window may overlap the selected screen area when you release the right mouse
 button.&nbsp; When this occurs, the magnifier captures the image of the resize window, not the original screen area.&nbsp;
 This only happens if the screen area you are selecting is close to the Zoom window.
</dl>
<h3 id="The_Begin_Zoom_Item"> The Begin Zoom Item </h3>
<br>The Begin Zoom item in the File menu allows you to scan the screen area without holding down the left mouse button.&nbsp;
 This is similar to the Sticky Magnifier feature that is offered in the Configure dialog.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>The Begin Zoom item is not available in Zoom for Win32.
</dl>
<br>To Zoom using the Begin Zoom item:
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Select Begin Zoom from the File menu.</b>
<br>This reveals the magnifier attached to your cursor.
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Position the magnifier over the screen area you want to magnify.</b>
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Resize the magnifier</b> as desired using the right mouse button.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click the left mouse button</b> to capture the selected screen area in the Zoom window.
</dl>
<h3 id="Pasting_with_Zoom"> Pasting with Zoom </h3>
<br>The paste function in Zoom allows you to paste whatever is in the Zoom window onto the clipboard.&nbsp; From here you
 can paste the clipping to other applications, such as the Image Editor.
<br><br>To paste the contents of the Zoom window to the clipboard, choose Paste to Clipboard from the File menu of the Open
 Watcom Zoom window.
<h2 id="Configuring_Zoom"> Configuring Zoom </h2>
<br>The Configure item under the File menu opens the Configure dialog.&nbsp; On this dialog you set certain options that dictate
 how the Zoom application behaves.&nbsp; Once you have selected the desired configure options, click on OK to store this information
 and close the Configure dialog.&nbsp; The following sections explain the options presented in the configure dialog.
<br><br><tt><img src="wzm2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 2.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> On the Configure dialog, you customize the behaviour of the Zoom application.</b>
<h3 id="Configuring_Zoom__Always_On_Top"> Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; Always On Top </h3>
<br>Selecting the Always On Top option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; ensures that the Zoom window will always appear on top of other
 windows.&nbsp; If this option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; is not selected, then when working with several windows at a time the
 Zoom window can get pushed behind other windows.
<h3 id="Configuring_Zoom__Sticky_Magnifier"> Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; Sticky Magnifier </h3>
<br>Selecting Sticky Magnifier is the same as using the Begin Zoom menu item.&nbsp; When this box is checked, the zooming
 interaction Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; changes.
<br><br>The Sticky Magnifier option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; dictates that you zoom by pressing the left mouse button once
 in the Zoom window to activate the zoom function Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; and then press it once more to capture the selected
 screen area.&nbsp; With this option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; you are able to drag the magnifier into position Configuring
 Zoom:&nbsp; without holding down the mouse button.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>The Sticky Magnifier option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; is not available in the Win32 version of Zoom.
</dl>
<h3 id="Configuring_Zoom__Auto_Refresh"> Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; Auto Refresh </h3>
<br>Normally, Zoom only refreshes the selected area in the Zoom window when the magnifier moves.&nbsp; When the Auto Refresh
 option Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; is selected, Zoom refreshes the image displayed in the Zoom window at regular intervals, as
 well as when the magnifier moves.&nbsp; This feature is useful when magnifying screen images that change frequently, such
 as the seconds on the clock application Configuring Zoom:.
<br><br>When the enable auto refresh box in the configuration Configuring Zoom:&nbsp; dialog is checked you can enter a value
 in the Interval field.&nbsp; This value specifies the interval in tenths of seconds that Zoom will wait between image refreshes.
