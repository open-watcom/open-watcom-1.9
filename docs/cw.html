<h1 id="Overview"> Overview </h1>
<br>CauseWay is a 386 DOS extender package for use with Open Watcom C/C++ programs.&nbsp; It is provided as a stub executable
 for which can be easily linked into DOS extended applications.
<h2 id="Introduction"> Introduction </h2>
<br>Within the standard DOS, Windows and OS/2 DOS box environments, CauseWay supports 32-bit memory models for applications
 on PC compatibles with an 80386SX processor or above without the need to use overlays or crude stopgap measures such as EMS/XMS
 swapping.&nbsp; To do this, the DOS extender runs applications in protected mode, rather than the real mode normally used
 in the DOS environments.&nbsp; CauseWay supports both 16-bit and 32-bit protected mode applications operating under a DOS
 environment.&nbsp; It makes full use of 386-level chip capabilities including demand paging of code and data, variable-sized
 segments up to 4GB in length, mixing 16- and 32-bit segments as well as support for flat (non-segmented) memory addressing
 models.&nbsp; The CauseWay implementation of these powerful capabilities provides all their benefits while being transparent
 to the application user.
<br><br>Applications created using CauseWay are compatible with the VCPI and DPMI standards and run equally well on systems
 with no protected mode drivers or programs.&nbsp; CauseWay applications work with such diverse environments as normal DOS,
 DesqView, Windows 3.0 and above in both standard and enhanced modes, as well as DOS windows within OS/2 2.0 and above, Windows
 95 and above and Windows NT and later.&nbsp; CauseWay allocates memory from DPMI, VCPI, XMS, and INT 15H services, in addition
 to conventional DOS memory.&nbsp; This allows CauseWay applications to allocate memory through the CauseWay DOS extender
 without the need to detect or manipulate the various memory handling schemes.
<br><br>A primary objective of CauseWay development was to ensure minimal effort would be needed by programmers to adapt their
 code to work with the CauseWay DOS e tender.&nbsp; As a result, most Open Watcom C/C++ and many realmode assembly language
 programs need no or minor changes to produce a fully operational CauseWay protected mode application.
<h2 id="Minimum_System_Requirements"> Minimum System Requirements </h2>
<br>CauseWay for Open Watcom C/C++ requires a 386SX based computer or better.&nbsp; The required operating environment is
 MS-DOS or PC-DOS 3.3 or higher, Windows 3.0 or higher, OS/2 2.0 and above, Windows 95 and above, Windows NT or higher or
 a compatible operating system that provides a DPMI or VCPI DOS environment.
<br><br>CauseWay is to a large extent compatible with Tenberry Software's DOS/4GW.&nbsp; Most applications built for DOS/4GW
 will run with CauseWay without any changes.
<h2 id="CauseWay_Memory_Requirements"> CauseWay Memory Requirements </h2>
<br>The recommended minimum amount of total free physical memory for CauseWay applications is 500KB total.&nbsp; 100-150KB
 of this memory must be conventional DOS memory, the remainder may be extended memory.&nbsp; CauseWay applications can run
 in less memory, down to the 300KB range, provided sufficient virtual (disk-based) memory is available, but application performance
 will decline significantly.&nbsp; More physical memory improves a program's performance, reducing virtual memory disk access
 overhead.
<h2 id="Operating_CauseWay"> Operating CauseWay </h2>
<br>When using CauseWay, simply follow the standard edit-compile/assemble-link programming cycle familiar to C and assembly
 language programmers.
<br><br>Users compiling with WCL386 need to add the switch /l=CauseWay to the command line.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WCL386 /l=CauseWay myprog.c</tt>
<br><br>This switch can be automated by adding /l#CauseWay to the<b> WCL386</b> environment variable, making CauseWay the
 default when compiling via WCL386.
<br><br>Open Watcom users linking with WLINK should add the statement<tt> system CauseWay</tt> to the link command.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WLINK system CauseWay file myprog.obj</tt>
<br><br>When running the DOS-extended application, DOS first loads the CauseWay DOS extender in conventional memory.&nbsp;
 CauseWay establishes the protected mode environment, retrieves the application from the executable file - loading it first
 into extended memory, then conventional memory if extended is exhausted, then virtual (disk-based) memory if conventional
 is exhausted - sets up the application for execution, and finally passes control to the application to begin operation.&nbsp;
 No additional files are required to make your application run in 386 protected mode using the CauseWay DOS extender.
<br><br><tt>CWSTUB.EXE</tt> will execute stand-alone LE-format files in the same way as<tt> DOS4GW.EXE</tt> does if the full
 file name, including extension, is listed after CWSTUB, e.g.<tt>&nbsp; CWSTUB RUNME.EXE.</tt>&nbsp; CWSTUB will override
 the extender bound to the application EXE, if any, with the CauseWay DOS extender version in<tt> CWSTUB.EXE.</tt>
<h2 id="Debugging_Using_WD"> Debugging Using WD </h2>
<br>To debug CauseWay programs with the Open Watcom debugger after installing the CauseWay files, simply use the /tr=cw command
 line option.
<br><br><b>Example:</b>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WD /tr=cw myprog</tt>
<br><br>This process can be automated by adding<tt> /tr#cw</tt> to your<b> WD</b> environment variable.&nbsp; Use the<tt>
 set WD=tr#cw</tt> command.
<br><br>By default, CauseWay uses a Ctrl-Alt keypress to interrupt the WD debugger, rather than the Print-Screen key.&nbsp;
 This can be changed to any two, three, or four keypress value by modifying the ASCII file<tt> CWHELP.CFG</tt> at the BreakKeys
 line.&nbsp; See comments in this file for further detail.&nbsp; Note that a single keypress value will not work properly.
<h2 id="Operational_Considerations_When_Using_CauseWay"> Operational Considerations When Using CauseWay </h2>
<br>The<b> TEMP</b> ,<b> TMP</b> and<b> CAUSEWAY=SWAP</b> environment variables are used by CauseWay to determine where to
 build its virtual memory swap file when an application is not operating under Windows or OS/2 (Windows and OS/2 provide their
 own virtual memory management).&nbsp; Since CauseWay has integrated virtual memory, disk space is considered part of total
 memory.&nbsp; If you use the<b> TEMP</b> ,<b> TMP</b> or<b> SWAP</b> environment variable to point to a small RAM sk or almost
 full disk, free memory will be affected accordingly.&nbsp; If virtual (disk-based) memory is less than physical (installed
 on machine) memory, Cause Way turns off virtual memory.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you have a disk 300MB free, CauseWay
 will have no problem reporting 300MB free memory to your program, provided that virtual memory is not inhibited or limited
 by the<b> CAUSEWAY</b> environment variable memory settings.
<br><br>Memory operates differently under Windows and OS/2.&nbsp; With OS/2, the DPMI setting for the session determines available
 memory.&nbsp; With Windows, available memory is the total of physical memory plus the swap file size less any memory already
 in use by Windows or another Windows application.
<br><br>When creating a VMM swap file at application startup under DOS, CauseWay builds a list of possible paths in order
 of priority.&nbsp; CauseWay then works through the list until one of the entries provides both a valid drive and path specification
 and sufficient free space to being operation.&nbsp; The first entry to succeed becomes the swap file drive with no further
 processing of the list.&nbsp; If CauseWay reaches the end of the list without finding a valid drive, it disables the virtual
 memory manager.&nbsp; The order of priority is<b> CAUSEWAY=SWAP</b> ,<b> TEMP</b> ,<b> TMP</b> and application execution
 path.
<br><br>If end users reboot the system or turn off power while executing a CauseWay application under DOS, a temporary file
 will be left on the system by CauseWay.&nbsp; This will usually be a zero length file unless the application was large enough
 to exceed physical memory and CauseWay had started using its virtual memory manager.&nbsp; The temporary file name is requested
 using standard DOS functions, meaning the name will vary with different versions of DOS.&nbsp; It typically is a mixture
 of letters and numbers with no extension, although .$$$ extension may be presented when operating under a network.&nbsp;
 Make sure you do not delete this temporary file while the CauseWay application is still active, as improper or erratic program
 operation, including lock-ups, may occur.
<br><br>Application startup times may increase significantly if the free physical memory is less than the executable size.
&nbsp; In such cases, not only must the executable be loaded into physical memory, but a virtual memory file of the executable
 file size must also be built.&nbsp; This file holds the portions of the executable that do not fit into physical memory and
 which have not been recently requested.&nbsp; After startup is complete, the program will operate normally, paging to and
 from virtual memory as necessary.
<br><br>CauseWay automatically sets aside 32KB of low DOS memory for allocation and use by developer routines via the GetMemDOS
 API function.&nbsp; The 32K memory block is available even if CauseWay needs to use virtual memory just to load an application.
&nbsp; The set-aside amount can be increased by using the<b> CAUSEWAY</b> environment variable LOWMEM option, although the
 additional set-aside goal is not guaranteed to be reached if too little conventional memory is left for CauseWay's operating
 requirements.
<h2 id="Environment_Variables"> Environment Variables </h2>
<br>CauseWay can make use of three environment variables at runtime:<b>&nbsp; TEMP</b> ,<b> TMP</b> and<b> CAUSEWAY</b> 
<h3 id="TEMP_and_TMP_Environment_Variables"> TEMP and TMP Environment Variables </h3>
<br>The<b> TEMP</b> and<b> TMP</b> environment variables specify the directory and drive where a swap file is built by CauseWay's
 virtual memory manager (VMM) when operating under DOS.&nbsp; Windows and OS/2 provide their own memory management functions
 which override CauseWay's use of the<b> TEMP</b> and<b> TMP</b> environment variables.&nbsp; The path indicated by<b> TEMP</b>
 will be used under DOS if both<b> TEMP</b> and<b> TMP</b> environment variables exist.&nbsp; Both settings are superseded
 by the<b> CAUSEWAY=SWAP</b> environment variable setting.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET TMP=C:\SWAP</tt>
<br><br>The example above directs the CauseWay DOS extender to create its swap file, if any, in the C:\SWAP directory.
<br><br>If no<b> TEMP</b> ,<b> TMP</b> and<b> CAUSEWAY=SWAP</b> settings are present or are invalid, the current drive is
 used when creating a swap file.&nbsp; If free drive space is less than physical memory (extended and conventional) available
 at startup, then the DOS extender VMM is disabled, no swap file is created, and virtual memory is not available to the application.
<h3 id="CAUSEWAY_Environment_Variable"> CAUSEWAY Environment Variable </h3>
<br>The<b> CAUSEWAY</b> environment variable controls operation of the DOS extender at application runtime.&nbsp; Eleven (11)
 options are supported, although they are ignored in a Windows or OS/2 DPMI environment.&nbsp; Use any combination of the
 options in the following format:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET CAUSEWAY=&#91;&lt;setting_1&gt;;&#93;&#91;&lt;setting_2&gt;;&#93;&#91;&lt;setting_n&gt;;&#93;</tt>
<br><br>Items in square brackets (&#91; &#93;) are optional.&nbsp; Do not actually type the brackets if you use the optional
 items.&nbsp; Items in brackets (&lt; &gt;) should be replaced with actual values, separated by semicolons.&nbsp; Following
 is a description of the valid settings:
<dl>
<dt>BIG1
<dd>
<br>Force CauseWay to use an alternate method to determine available extended memory under RAW memory environments (no DPMI
 host, no HIMEM.SYS loaded), allowing CauseWay to see more than 64MB of memory on machines which do not support more than
 64MB under original INT 15h method.&nbsp; This method uses INT 15h function 0e801h to determine available extended memory,
 falling back to the original function if 0e801h fails.&nbsp; Note that old machines may not support this function and there
 is a slight chance that some older machines may not work if this setting is used.
<dt><br>DPMI
<dd>
<br>Force DPMI rather than default VCPI usage whenever possible (recommended for 386Max and BlueMax users).&nbsp; The memory
 manager must support DPMI or else this setting is ignored.
<dt><br>EXTALL
<dd>
<br>Force CauseWay to use all extended memory and sub-allocate memory from the bottom up instead of the default top-down approach.
&nbsp; This setting is most useful for processor intensive environments which have a small hardware cache that does not cover
 the entire physical address range.&nbsp; Use of this setting means that no extended memory will be available for other programs
 while the application is loaded (including shelling to DOS).
<dt><br>HIMEM:&lt;nnn&gt;
<dd>
<br>Set maximum physical (conventional plus extended) memory that can be consumed by CauseWay where<tt> &lt;nnn&gt;</tt> is
 the decimal number of kilobytes that can be consumed.&nbsp; If memory allocation requests exceed this figure, CauseWay will
 use virtual memory, even if additional physical memory is present.&nbsp; If the HIMEM memory value exceeds available physical
 memory, then memory allocations operate normally.&nbsp; For example, HIMEM:2048 on a 4MB machine would force virtual memory
 use after 2MB of memory allocations (including loading the executable file).&nbsp; The remaining 2MB of memory could be used
 by other applications while the CauseWay application is active.
<dt><br>LOWMEM:&lt;nnn&gt;
<dd>
<br>Set DOS (conventional) memory to restrict it from use by CauseWay.&nbsp; This memory is in addition to the default 32KB
 low DOS memory block reserved by CauseWay for use by any applications which need to allocate DOS memory.<tt>&nbsp; &lt;nnn&gt;</tt>
 is the decimal number of kilobytes to reserve.&nbsp; If there is not enough conventional memory to satisfy the<tt> &lt;nnn&gt;</tt>
 request value, then CauseWay will leave all conventional memory free that is not required by the extender to operate.&nbsp;
 Note that this option does not guarantee the amount of free DOS memory, just how much needs to be free before CauseWay will
 consume DOS memory after exhausting all extended memory.&nbsp; For example, LOWMEM:200 will attempt to reserve 200KB of DOS
 memory, even if CauseWay has exhausted all extended memory and is using conventional memory to fill memory allocation requests.
<dt><br>MAXMEM:&lt;nn&gt;
<dd>
<br>Set maximum linear address space provided by CauseWay where<tt> &lt;nn&gt;</tt> is the decimal number of megabytes of
 linear address space.&nbsp; This setting is similar to HIMEM except that it includes any virtual memory.&nbsp; For example,
 MAXMEM:32 on a 16MB memory system restricts VMM disk space usage to 32MB, even if more disk space is present.&nbsp; MAXMEM:8
 on the same system would restrict the application to 8MB of memory (all physical).&nbsp; Note that the setting is in megabytes,
 rather than kilobytes used in the LOWMEM and HIMEM options.
<dt><br>NAME:&lt;filename&gt;
<dd>
<br>Set a name, without a pathspec, to use the virtual memory temporary swap file.&nbsp; To set a path for the swap file,
 use the<b> CAUSEWAY=SWAP</b> ,<b> TEMP</b> , or<b> TMP</b> environment variable.&nbsp; The filename must be valid, 12 characters
 or less.&nbsp; Additional characters are truncated or invalidate the filename, depending upon how DOS handles it (e.g., multiple
 periods make an invalid file name whereas a five-character extension is truncated to three).&nbsp; If the filename specified
 is invalid, CauseWay shuts off virtual memory.&nbsp; It makes no further attempts for a temporary file name.&nbsp; If a pre-existing
 file name is specified, CauseWay overwrites the file.
<br>In conjunction with the PRE setting, the NAME setting can be a very powerful tool.&nbsp; Not only can no clusters be lost
 due to reset/reboot, but the leftover temporary file can be forced to a known name and location.&nbsp; Erase the swap file
 prior to running the application or leave it as a &quot;permanent&quot; swap file for CauseWay.
<br><br>Note:&nbsp; In a multi-user or muti-CauseWay application situation, do not use the NAME setting unless it generates
 a unique file for each user and application.&nbsp; Otherwise, applications will be stepping on others' temporary files.
<dt><br>NOEX
<dd>
<br>Force CauseWay to not patch the INT 21h, function 4bh (EXEC) vector to turn off CauseWay's INT 31h extensions when the
 EXEC function is called.&nbsp; CauseWay normally turns off support of its INT 31h extensions with an EXEC call to be well
 behaved and avoid conflicts with other extenders or programs which may add their own extensions to INT 31h.&nbsp; However,
 if your CauseWay extended application shells out to DOS and passes the shelled-to application a callback address pointing
 to a routine within the parent CauseWay application, the callback will not work properly if the protected mode code uses
 the CauseWay extensions.&nbsp; With the NOEX setting present, CauseWay still supports its INT 31h extensions for those users
 who need to operate with callbacks in this fashion.&nbsp; Be aware that when the NOEX setting is present, CauseWay is less
 &quot;well-behaved&quot; about other programs which might add their own INT 31h extensions.
<dt><br>NOVM
<dd>
<br>Disable all virtual memory use by CauseWay.&nbsp; If physical memory is exhausted, CauseWay will fail further memory allocation
 requests.
<dt><br>PRE:&lt;nnn&gt;
<dd>
<br>Pre-allocates a swap file size, under non-DPMI environments, at start-up, where<tt> &lt;nnn&gt;</tt> is file size in megabytes,
 not kilobytes (same as MAXMEM).
<br>There are at least two uses for this feature.&nbsp; First, to pre-allocate a virtual memory file size for applications
 with a total memory allocation (including EXE image) that does not exceed the set size.&nbsp; For example:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET CAUSEWAY=PRE:4</tt>
<br><br>pre-allocates a virtual memory file of 4MB.&nbsp; If an enduser resets or powers off the computer while the application
 is running and virtual memory is in use, the enduser's machine will not have lost clusters.&nbsp; There is only a 4MB temporary
 file to find and erase.&nbsp; If virtual memory usage exceeds 4MB, then SCANDISK must be used to recover lost clusters above
 and beyond what was pre-allocated.
<br><br>Secondly, PRE can be used to allow your application to stake a claim to disk space before it needs it.
<br><br>PRE may be used in conjunction with MAXMEM to ensure that virtual memory does not exceed the pre-allocation setting.
<dt><br>SWAP:&lt;path&gt;
<dd>
<br>Set CauseWay's virtual memory manager swap file path.&nbsp; This path takes precedence for choosing the location of a
 swap file over the<b> TEMP</b> and<b> TMP</b> environment variables.
</dl>
<h1 id="Using_the_flat_memory_model"> Using the flat memory model </h1>
<br>Flat model is a non-segmented memory model that allows accessing data and executing code anywhere within the 4GB linear
 address region via a 32-bit offset without the need to use segment registers to point to the memory.&nbsp; In many respects,
 the memory model is identical to the tiny memory model well-known to DOS C and assembly language programmers, but supporting
 a memory region of 4GB rather than 64KB.
<br><br>When using flat model, all linear addresses directly map to the physical address specified when an application is
 running in pure DOS environment.&nbsp; For example, writing to memory location 0B8000h will address video memory.&nbsp; Reading
 from memory locations in the 0FFF00h range will access ROM code.&nbsp; Under DPMI there is usually no direct relationship
 between linear and physical addresses, the DPMI host will however emulate access to memory below 1MB as appropriate without
 requiring any special considerations on the part of the application writer.
<br><br>Generally speaking, flat is an improved version of the older near memory model supported in previous versions of CauseWay.
&nbsp; Unlike near, flat model supports multiple segments, mixing 16- and 32-bit segments, and direct linear memory addresses
 without translation.&nbsp; Flat model supports all near memory model code without translation, including automatic handling
 of near-specific API functions.
<h1 id="Using_DLLs_with_Open_Watcom_CDCPP"> Using DLLs with Open Watcom C/C++ </h1>
<br>It is recommended that you understand and familiarize yourself with the basic operation of DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)
 under Windows or OS/2 before using them with CauseWay under DOS.&nbsp; No attempt is made here to explain the fundamentals
 of DLL architecture and operation.&nbsp; You should also study the provided DLL example code.
<br><br>DLL code should be compiled with the /s option to disable stack checking and the /bd option to generate DLL-suitable
 code.&nbsp; Specify a system type of<tt> CWDLLR</tt> for register-based parameter passing or<tt> CWDLLS</tt> for stack-based
 parameter passing.
<br><br>A DLL file is a standard EXE file with the following requirement:&nbsp; The program start address should be an initialization
 and termination function, rather than a main program entry point.&nbsp; The entry address will be called twice:&nbsp; Once
 after loading to allow the DLL to perform initialization and once just prior to the DLL being unloaded from memory to allow
 it to clean up for termination.&nbsp; Entry conditions are:&nbsp; register EAX=0 for initialization and register EAX=1 for
 termination.&nbsp; An initialization code return value of EAX=0 indicates no errors.&nbsp; A code of any other value indicates
 an error has occurred and loading should be terminated.&nbsp; If an error condition is returned, it is up to the DLL to display
 an error message, CauseWay will simply report a load error.&nbsp; The entry address is a FAR call, so the initialization
 code should use a RETF to return control to the calling program.
<br><br>A minimal DLL startup system is provided in the<tt> DLLSTRTR.OBJ</tt> (register-based) and the<tt> DLLSTRTS.OBJ</tt>
 (stack-based) files.
<br><br>CauseWay loads DLLs when the program being loaded has references to external modules in the DLL.&nbsp; CauseWay searches
 the execution path for any DLL or EXE file (in that order) which has the proper internal module name.&nbsp; The module name
 is not used when searching.&nbsp; For example, a file named<tt> USEME.DLL</tt> contains a module named Spelling_Checker.
&nbsp; The name of the module (Spelling_Checker) is set by the NAME option in your link file.&nbsp; If no NAME is specified,
 then the module's name will default to its file name without an extension.&nbsp; In this example, the module name would become
 USEME if no NAME is specified.
<br><br>Following is an overview of the standard link file commands used to create DLLs.&nbsp; You may also refer to the Open
 Watcom Linker documentation for a description of these commands.
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXPORT function_name</tt>
<dl>
<dt>where
<dd><b>description</b>
<dt><br>function_name
<dd>allows you to make a symbol (function name) available to other modules.&nbsp; It must be declared as a public symbol so that
 the linker can export it.

<dl>
<dt>where
<dd><b>description</b>
<dt><br>local_name
<dd>is an optional parameter.&nbsp; It is the symbol which the importing program references the function by, i.e.&nbsp; the symbol
 declared as external.&nbsp; If no local name is specified, then<b> function_name</b> is used.
<dt><br>module_name
<dd>is the name of the module that contains the function.&nbsp; It is not the file name.&nbsp; IMPORT module names are resolved
 by searching DLL and EXE files for the correct module name.
<dt><br>function_name
<dd>is the symbol by which the function is known in the EXPORTing module, i.e.&nbsp; the symbol that is declared as public.
<dt><br>ordinal_number
<dd>functions can also be imported by number.&nbsp; This is the entry number in decimal, starting at 1, in the EXPORTing module's
 export table to link to.<b>&nbsp; local_name</b> must be specified when using ordinals, otherwise there is no symbolic reference
 to internally resolve.
<br>In the DLL calling code,<b> local_name</b> and<b> function_name</b> need to be declared as external.

<dt><br>module_name
<dd>is a symbol by which the module should be identified when resolving IMPORT records in a calling program.
<br>IMPORTed module names can contain a partial path.&nbsp; For example, DLL\spelling_checker would instruct the loader to
 look in &lt;execution path&gt;\DLL for a module with a name of spelling_checker.
<br><br>Notes:
<br><br>You must take the responsibility to make sure that the IMPORTed function or module calling conventions match the calling
 code.&nbsp; For example, the loader will load a 16-bit module to resolve an IMPORT in a 32-bit program without complaint.
&nbsp; In this case, if the IMPORTing program does a 16-bit far call, then everything will work correctly, but a 32-bit call
 will fail unless the 16-bit DLL module ends with a 32-bit RET instruction.
<br><br>Importing by function name may slow program performance if the symbols are frequently referenced.&nbsp; In such cases,
 consider using the ordinal command to speed up the access times because module name references are automatically converted
 to ordinals in an internal list which will only be processed once at load time.

<h1 id="Performance_Considerations"> Performance Considerations </h1>
<br>There are a few ways to increase the operational efficiency of your CauseWay applications.
<h2 id="Memory_Size"> Memory Size </h2>
<br>Almost without exception, the best way to increase runtime performance of all CauseWay applications is to ensure that
 physical memory is large enough to meet all of the program's needs.&nbsp; Performance suffers considerably when CauseWay
 creates a temporary file for virtual memory, swapping 4KB blocks of the program's code and data to and from disk.&nbsp; Naturally
 this may not be possible in all cases, but it is a worthy goal.&nbsp; Generally the more physical memory, even when virtual
 memory is being used, the better an application's performance.
<br><br>When using a disk cache program, be sure not to use too much extended memory.&nbsp; Although a disk cache program
 is beneficial, allocating it too much memory can deprive CauseWay of required extended memory and can degrade application
 performance.&nbsp; However completely disabling disk cache will usually noticeably decrease performance as well.&nbsp; The
 optimal cache size depends on the particular application and computer system (amount of physical memory, disk I/O speed etc.)
 and there are no generally applicable &quot;best&quot; settings.
<br><br>If your program uses virtual memory, CauseWay's VMM creates a temporary swap file.&nbsp; If you have more than one
 disk drive, then you may wish to direct creation of the swap file to the faster disk drive on your system using the<b> CAUSEWAY=SWAP</b>
 ,<b> TEMP</b> or<b> TMP</b> environment variables.&nbsp; Do not create a RAM disk if this will lower your physical memory
 because this is less efficient than allowing CauseWay to use physical memory itself.
<br><br>Remember that virtual memory is part of total memory when using CauseWay.&nbsp; If your default drive, or the drive
 pointed to by the<b> TEMP</b> or<b> TMP</b> environment variables has little free space, this will be reflected in total
 memory available to the CauseWay application.&nbsp; If disk free space is less than physical memory, then CauseWay shuts
 off all use of virtual memory.&nbsp; Windows and OS/2 handle virtual memory internally and supply it through the swap file
 and DPMI settings for the application.
<h2 id="Open_Watcom_CDCPP_kbhitLR_replacement"> Open Watcom C/C++ kbhit() replacement </h2>
<br>Two optimized replacement versions of the Open Watcom C++ runtime library kbhit() function are provided.&nbsp; The files
 are KBHITR.OBJ and KBHITS.OBJ for, respectively, register-based and stack-based calling conventions.&nbsp; Simply link in
 the kbhit() replacement file appropriate for your compile options.&nbsp; These replacement routines bypass the normal INT
 checking of the keyboard and directly inspect the keyboard buffer to see if a keypress is pending.&nbsp; These routines significantly
 reduce the overhead in tight processing loops, which perform many kbhit()'s per second, by avoiding the interrupt call associated
 with checking for keystrokes.
<br><br>Be aware that linking in the kbhitr or kbhits module means that the INT 28h idle call will not be made on kbhit()
 as normally occurs with the standard runtime library kbhit().&nbsp; This may impact background processing in applications
 which depend on INT 28h idle calls, such as the DOS PRINT utility which performs printing in the background, as well as operation
 under multitatsking environments.
<h2 id="DOS_API_Buffer_Size"> DOS API Buffer Size </h2>
<br>If your CauseWay application reads and writes files using large amounts of data on one read or write pass, you may wish
 to consider increasing the size of the internal DOS memory transfer buffer used by CauseWay.&nbsp; Refer to the SetDOSTrans
 and GetDOSTrans functions in the CauseWay API chapter for more information.
<br><br>Note that the internal 8KB buffer is optimized for file transfers.&nbsp; Average file transfers of greater than 8KB
 will not necessarily improve performance with an increase in the buffer size.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the average file
 transfer must be 32KB or larger to gain any efficiency with an increased buffer size.&nbsp; Also, if you are using virtual
 memory, increasing the buffer size may actually slow down performance due to the decreased available physical memory.&nbsp;
 Test your application with both the default buffer and the desired new buffer size before permanently increasing the buffer
 size beyond the default.
<h2 id="API_Memory_Allocation"> API Memory Allocation </h2>
<br>Inveterate tweakers may try out the SetMCBMax and GetMCBSize functions in the CauseWay API.&nbsp; These functions allow
 fine-tuning of the threshold used by CauseWay to allocate memory via a memory pool using memory control blocks (MCBs) rather
 than via normal DPMI functions.&nbsp; Since DPMI allocates memory in multiples of 4KB, setting the MCB threshold too low
 may result in a good deal of wasted memory and subsequent performance degradation.
<h1 id="Rules_For_Protected_Mode_Operation"> Rules For Protected Mode Operation </h1>
<br>The following information covers additional restrictions for protected mode compatible code that are not present when
 writing real mode compatible code.
<br><br>Using protected mode rather than real mode requires following a few new programming rules to prevent processor faults
 from being generated, terminating the CauseWay application.&nbsp; These processor faults occur when an application breaks
 a protected mode programming rule.
<br><br>Use the following rules for programming in protected mode:
<ol>
<li>A selector value (referred to as a segment value in real mode) loaded into a segment register references an area of memory
 that may occur anywhere within the machine's physical address space.&nbsp; The operating system can dynamically move this
 area of memory.&nbsp; Therefore, when dealing with selector values:
<ul>
<li>Never use segment registers as general purpose registers that can be loaded with arbitrary values.&nbsp; Every time a
 segment register is loaded with a value the processor checks the validity of the selector value and generates a fault if
 it is invalid.
<li>Never perform segment arithmetic on a selector value.&nbsp; Segment arithmetic is usually performed in real mode code
 to either normalize a pointer, access a new paragraph of memory without changing an offset, or to access a single area of
 memory that is greater than 64KB in size.&nbsp; Since a selector value is an index into a table which contains the actual
 memory addresses, addition or subtraction of different selector values is meaningless and gives no useful results.&nbsp;
 (There exist special cases where contiguous selector values can be added or subtracted from for useful effect, but detailing
 these cases exceed the scope of this manual.)
<li>Do not access data at an offset greater than the size of the associated selector.&nbsp; Attempts to do so result in a
 fault.&nbsp; This is one of the greatest strengths of protected mode because most obscure bugs in real mode code occur when
 a bad pointer value accesses the wrong area of memory, or when a buffer overflows and memory beyond the buffer is overwritten.
<li>Do not attempt to write to or read from the NULL (zero value) segment.&nbsp; Attempts to do so results in a fault.&nbsp;
 In addition to valid selector values, segment registers can be safely loaded with a value of 0 but this selector value cannot
 be used to access memory or execute code.
</ul>
<li>Do not execute code in a data segment and do not write to data in the code segment.&nbsp; Use the CauseWay AliasSel function
 to map a data selector to the same physical memory area shared by a code selector when necessary.&nbsp; Even in this case,
 however, never write to memory using a CS:&nbsp; code segment override because it always causes a processor fault.
<li>CauseWay handles most of the standard DOS interrupts transparently.&nbsp; When passing pointers to buffers for software
 interrupt calls not handled by CauseWay, create the buffers in low (conventional) DOS memory using the GetMemDOS function
 of the CauseWay API.&nbsp; In addition, convert the pointers from protected mode selector:offset pairs to real mode segment:offset
 pairs prior to the interrupt, and back upon your return from the interrupt.
</ol>
<h1 id="CW_ERR_File_Information_Format"> CW.ERR File Information Format </h1>
<br>The following information describes the format of the CW.ERR file that CauseWay creates if an exception occurs in a CauseWay
 application.&nbsp; This information can be very useful in tracking down exactly where and why an exception occurred.
<h2 id="Quick_Reference_Guide"> Quick Reference Guide </h2>
<br>If you do not know how to interpret assembly language or CPU instructions, and you want better detail on the location
 of an exception, you can frequently identify which routine caused the exception by cross-referencing the MAP file with the
 CW.ERR file.&nbsp; Following is a short guide to determine the offending routine.
<br><br>Look at the value after the dash (-) listed for the CS segment register at the beginning of the ninth line in CW.ERR.
&nbsp; This should be an eight digit number starting with several zeros.&nbsp; Now look at the MAP file of your application.
&nbsp; Following the program, creation date and time lines in the MAP file is a listing of program segments showing their
 start, stop, length, name, class and count.&nbsp; Find the segment which has a start address equal to the eight digit number
 listed above.&nbsp; This is the entry for the program segment where the exception occurred.
<br><br>Locate the public symbols listed by address in the MAP file.&nbsp; Each symbol in the program is listed in ascending
 address order.&nbsp; The address is composed of two values separated by a colon (:).&nbsp; Find the address group which begins
 with the eight digit number given above for CS segment register without the last digit.&nbsp; For example, if the CS eight
 digit number was 000205E0, look for an address beginning with 0000205E.&nbsp; If you cannot find any addresses beginning
 with the number, either no routines in the segment were declared public or else you have a version of the MAP file that was
 created at a different time than the application EXE file which generated the CW.ERR file.
<br><br>If there is only one address beginning with the number, you have located the offending routine.&nbsp; If there is
 more than one address, examine the EIP value in CW.ERR.&nbsp; The EIP value is located in the middle of the seventh line
 immediately following the &quot;EIP=&quot; text.&nbsp; This value is the offset in the segment where the exception occurred.
&nbsp; Find the symbol in the address group which has an address value following the &quot;:&quot; that is closest to the
 EIP but does not exceed the EIP value.&nbsp; This name of the symbol is the name of the routine which generated the exception.
&nbsp; To continue our example, if you have the following four symbols of address 0000205E in the first half of the address
 line in the map file :
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000205E:000008DC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __DBFGOHOT</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000205E:00000944&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __DBFGOCOLD</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000205E:00000986&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __DBFGOTOID</tt>
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000205E:00000AEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __DBFGOTOP</tt>
<br><br>and the EIP value is 00000953, the closest routine name that does not exceed the EIP value in the second half of the
 address line is<tt> __DBFGOCOLD.</tt>&nbsp; Therefore, the exception occurred in the<tt> __DBFGOCOLD</tt> routine.
<br><br>This method of locating the exception is not foolproof since it requires that the routine creating the exception in
 the program segment be declared public, but it should work for the majority of cases.
<h2 id="Sequence"> Sequence </h2>
<br>The first line in CW.ERR is the CauseWay copyright message including the version of CauseWay used in the program.&nbsp;
 The version number may prove useful in tracking down problems that have been addressed in later versions of CauseWay.
<br><br>The version is followed by the exception number and error code.&nbsp; These numbers, as well as all others in the
 CW.ERR file, are in hexadecimal.&nbsp; The values listed are those reported by the processor when the exception occurred.
&nbsp; Detailed information about the significance of the values can be obtained in most 386 and above reference books.&nbsp;
 Typically the exception value will be 0DH, a General Protection Fault; 0CH, a stack fault usually due to stack overflow or
 underflow; or 0EH, a page fault due to improper memory reference.&nbsp; The error code is generally of little use for debugging
 purposes.
<br><br>Next comes the general register values which indicate the state of the program when the exception occurred.&nbsp;
 The significance of register values is entirely dependent on the program being run at the time.&nbsp; CS:EIP register values
 can help track down the problem area by pinpointing exactly where in the code the exception occurred.&nbsp; Other register
 values may help determine why the exception occurred.&nbsp; In particular, look for use of registers as memory indices with
 values beyond the limit of the associated selector.
<br><br>Next, the segment register values are displayed as a real selector value followed by the program relative value in
 bytes.&nbsp; If the second value is non-numeric (xxxxxxxx) then the segment register didn't contain a selector value allocated
 to the program at load time, although the value may be valid if it was dynamically allocated by the operating program.&nbsp;
 If there is a second value, it also appears in the program's .MAP file as the segment start address.&nbsp; This shows which
 segment a segment register is pointing to at the time of the exception.&nbsp; The CS (Code Segment) register points to the
 segment containing the code which is executing.&nbsp; The EIP register value indicates the offset within the CS segment where
 the exception occurred.&nbsp; With these two values, you can not only determine the segment, but the routine within the segment
 closest to where the exception occurred.
<br><br>Segment register values are also useful in determining why an exception occurred.&nbsp; One common error is using
 an invalid selector value in DS, ES, FS, or GS.&nbsp; A segment register value of zero does not automatically indicate problem,
 but will cause a GPF if used to read or write to memory.&nbsp; In particular, be highly suspicious of DS and ES segment register
 values of 0000-xxxxxxxx since they are almost constantly used to to access memory.&nbsp; A zero value in DS or ES usually
 indicates a bad (NULL) memory pointer passed to a routine.
<br><br>Next, the processor control register values are listed.&nbsp; These registers are unlikely to be of much use for debugging
 and will only be filled in when not running under a true DPMI host.&nbsp; For an exception 0Eh (page fault), CR2 is the linear
 address that was accessed for which no memory was mapped in.&nbsp; This may help track down the problem area.
<br><br>Info Flags comes next.&nbsp; This value is returned by CauseWay's Info API function.&nbsp; Check it against the documentation
 for Info in the CauseWay API chapter to determine some aspects of the environment in which the program was running when the
 exception occurred, e.g.&nbsp; whether a DPMI host was being used.
<br><br>Program Linear Load Address follows Info Flags.&nbsp; This value is th executable's load address in linear memory.
&nbsp; It corresponds to one of the linear memory block entries described later.
<br><br>In flat models, the EIP value minus the program linear load address is the address offset of the faulting location
 relative to the start of the program.
<br><br>Following Program Linear Load Address is a display of the next 128 byte values at the CS:EIP location when the exception
 occurred.&nbsp; These are the hexadecimal byte values of the CPU instructions at the time of the exception.&nbsp; 386 reference
 books or some debuggers can be used to reconstruct the instruction operation codes that correspond to these hexadecimal byte
 values.
<br><br>The SS:ESP displays follows CS:EIP.&nbsp; This display shows the last 128 bytes values stored on the CPU stack.
<br><br>SS:EBP is next.&nbsp; It shows 128 byte values of the current stack frame negatively and positively offset from the
 current EBP value.&nbsp; C and other high level language routines use the EBP register to reference parameters passed on
 the stack and this display can show which parameters were passed.
<br><br>The resource tracking details come next.&nbsp; Selectors are listed with the following headings:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sel&nbsp; base&nbsp; limit&nbsp; type&nbsp; D&nbsp; mem&nbsp; count</tt>
<dl>
<dt>where
<dd><b>description</b>
<dt><br>sel
<dd>Selector value.
<dt><br>base
<dd>Linear base address of selector.
<dt><br>limit
<dd>Limit of selector.
<dt><br>type
<dd>CODE or DATA.
<dt><br>D
<dd>16 or 32 to signify segment D bit.
<dt><br>mem
<dd>Y or N to indicate if the selector has a memory block associated with it.
<dt><br>count
<dd>segment count in MAP file, xxxx if dynamically allocated.
</dl>
<br>The selector list is finished off with a display of the total number of selectors allocated to the program.&nbsp; For
 example:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total selectors: 0107</tt>
<br><br>Linear memory blocks are listed following the selector list, and contain the following headings:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handle&nbsp; base&nbsp; length</tt>
<dl>
<dt>where
<dd><b>description</b>
<dt><br>handle
<dd>Linear memory &#91;de&#93;allocation uses handles to control the blocks.&nbsp; This field is the block's handle.
<dt><br>base
<dd>Linear base address of the memory block.
<dt><br>length
<dd>Length of the block in bytes.
</dl>
<br>The linear memory list ends with a display of the total linear memory allocated to the program, the real (rounded to 4KB
 pages) memory allocated in parentheses, and finally the total number of memory blocks.&nbsp; For example:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Linear memory: 000FEAC9 (001AA000) in 00000103 blocks</tt>
<br><br>Entries in the selector list that have Y under &quot;mem&quot; should have a corresponding entry in the linear memory
 list.
<br><br>Linear memory locks are listed after the linear memory block list and contain the following headings:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; base&nbsp; length</tt>
<dl>
<dt>where
<dd><b>description</b>
<dt><br>base
<dd>Linear base of the locked region.
<dt><br>limit
<dd>Length of the locked region.
</dl>
<br>Note:&nbsp; These values are passed by the program but the actual values have the base rounded down a page and the length
 rounded up a page to match 4KB boundary restrictions on locking.&nbsp; The values are reported in CW.ERR without using a
 rounded format to make it easier to cross reference this list to the other lists in CW.ERR.
<br>Next, protected mode interrupt vectors are listed with the following headings:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; sel&nbsp; offset</tt>
<dl>
<dt>where
<dd><b>description</b>
<dt><br>No
<dd>Vector number.
<dt><br>sel
<dd>Selector value for handler.
<dt><br>offset
<dd>Offset value for handler.
</dl>
<br>This information allows a cross-reference with the other lists to ensure CauseWay application installed handlers have
 been properly made.
<br>Next, protected mode exception vectors are listed using the same format as protected mode interrupts.
<br><br>After the protected mode exception vector list, real mode interrupt vectors are listed.&nbsp; They are shown in the
 same format as protected mode interrupts although the selector values are real mode segment values.
<br><br>Only those interrupt and exception vectors altered by the program will be listed.
<br><br>Lastly, Callbacks are listed in the CW.ERR file.&nbsp; They list all active Callbacks for the active application at
 the time of its termination.
<h1 id="CauseWay_Services"> CauseWay Services </h1>
<br><br>The following information describes the services available through CauseWay for low-level protected mode compatible
 functions and interrupt servicing.
<br><br>The CauseWay services support both 16- and 32-bit selectors.&nbsp; Use of 32-bit selectors allows developers to directly
 access many megabytes of memory in a CauseWay program using only one selector value.&nbsp; In addition to the normal segment
 registers used in real mode programs, the additional segment registers FS and GS are always available for use by developers
 to access memory.&nbsp; Refer to a 386, 486, Pentium or compatible CPU reference book or manual for more information on 386+
 level registers and instructions.
<h2 id="Internal_Operation"> Internal Operation </h2>
<br>A valid protected mode selector:offset is placed in the PSP at offset 34h for the file handle list pointer.&nbsp; Note
 that the default value in the program's PSP will point to the real mode PSP, not the protected mode PSP, even if the handle
 count is less than or equal to twenty.&nbsp; Code that makes use of the handle list should use the address at PSP+34h rather
 than assuming the list's position within the PSP.&nbsp; Also, when an application is operating in non-DPMI conditions the
 handle table will have an entry for CauseWay's VMM swap file.
<br><br>The GetMem and GetMem32 calls with CX:DX and ECX set to -1 will report the largest free memory block, rather than
 total free memory.&nbsp; This value may be substantially lower than total free memory due to fragmentation of the linear
 memory blocks.&nbsp; Set CX to -1 (0FFFFH) and DX to -2 (0FFFEH) or ECX to -2 (0FFFFFFFEH) for GetMem and GetMem32, respectively,
 for the total free memory value.
<h2 id="Functions"> Functions </h2>
<br>The CauseWay functions are based on the DPMI specification and offer additional enhancements.&nbsp; This means that several
 of the DPMI 1.0 functions are available to the CauseWay programmer in all systems providing access to lower level functions
 should you need them.&nbsp; All DPMI 0.9 functions are always available.
<h2 id="CauseWay_API"> CauseWay API </h2>
<br>CauseWay provides an API for C and assembly language programmers as an extension of the DPMI API via INT 31h.&nbsp; Including
 the file CW.INC allows easy access to this API through appropriately named functions.&nbsp; You may also call the CauseWay
 API directly with appropriate register setup.
<br><br>CauseWay also provides all of the DPMI 0.9 API services on systems without a true DPMI server (thus CauseWay itself
 is the DPMI host in such situations).
<br><br>Some of the API services require pointers to a real mode register list.&nbsp; The format of this list follows:
<br><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<br><br>The values are passed to the target routine without any interpretation of their contents.&nbsp; There is no need to
 set the high words of the extended register entries unless the target routine requires them.
<h2 id="Stack_Frames"> Stack Frames </h2>
<br>Stack frames for 16-bit interrupts are the same as for real mode.
<br><br>The stack frame for 16-bit exceptions follows:

 on each call as does GetMem because a non-zero offset from an existing selector for this allocation type is returned.&nbsp;
 GetMemSO is useful for applications which make a large number of allocations where running out of selectors with GetMem could
 be a problem.&nbsp; A potential drawback is that memory accesses beyond the allocation boundary may go undetected since the
 selector is shared among several allocations.&nbsp; Also, resizing the block can change the selector:offset of the block.

<h2 id="API_Notes"> API Notes </h2>
<br>A fixed segment selector at 40h is always available to the application.&nbsp; This selector maps the real mode memory
 at 400h where most of the BIOS variables can be found.&nbsp; CauseWay also provides selectors at standard video addresses
 0B000h, 0B800h and 0A000h in non-DPMI environments to ease conversion of real mode code.
<br><br>The environment variable block address in the Program Segment Prefix (PSP) is a valid protected mode selector.&nbsp;
 A valid protected mode selector:offset is also placed in the PSP at offset 34h for the file handle list pointer.&nbsp; Note
 that the default value in the program's PSP will point to the real mode PSP, not the protected mode PSP, even if the handle
 count is less than or equal to twenty.&nbsp; Code that makes use of the handle list should use the address at PSP+34h rather
 than assuming the list's position within the PSP.&nbsp; Also, when an application is operating non-DPMI conditions the handle
 table will have an entry for CauseWay's VMM swap file.
<br><br>DOS functions which use the obsolete file control blocks (FCBs) are not supported by CauseWay, although such support
 may be added by the developer.
<br><br>CauseWay applications should terminate using INT 21H function 4Ch.&nbsp; As with real mode operation, the error level
 passed to this function in the AL register is returned to the parent program or DOS.
<br><br>If a CauseWay application needs to terminate and stay resident (TSR), then INT 21H function 31h may be used.&nbsp;
 Unlike real mode operation, no memory value is required for this function.&nbsp; All memory owned by the application when
 the TSR function is issued remains the program's property.&nbsp; There is currently no way of removing the CauseWay application
 from memory once it becomes a TSR without rebooting the machine or using a third party TSR manager.&nbsp; However, a TSR
 manager will not automatically release extended memory allocated for the CauseWay TSR.
<br><br>Unhandled exceptions terminate the program with a register display dump to screen and a text file called CW.ERR.&nbsp;
 CW.ERR contains other potentially useful information about the state of the application when it terminated.&nbsp; Refer to
 the appendices for more information on the CW.ERR file information format.
<br><br>CauseWay runs applications at privilege level 3.&nbsp; Privilege level 0 reserved instructions will cause a general
 protection fault (GPF).&nbsp; CauseWay emulates the four instructions MOV EAX,CR0; MOV CR0,EAX; MOV EAX,CR3; and MOV CR3,EAX
 in the GPF handler so that they may be used by an application.
<br><br>CauseWay will match a DPMI 0A00h function call with target string RATIONAL/4G.&nbsp; This in conjunction with CR0
 emulation allows support of floating point emulation by an exception handler.&nbsp; Watcom uses this approach under DOS/4GW
 operation if the floating point emulation library is not linked in.&nbsp; Note that this routine does not work for either
 CauseWay or DOS/4GW under a DPMI host such as Windows or OS/2.
<h1 id="Interrupt_Services"> Interrupt Services </h1>
<h2 id="Extended_or_Altered_Interrupt_Services"> Extended or Altered Interrupt Services </h2>
<br>The size of registers used by CauseWay's extended or modified interrupt services depends on the limit of the selector.
&nbsp; Extended 32-bit registers are used for 32-bit sized selectors and 16-bit registers are used for selectors within 16-bits.
&nbsp; To reflect this, the convention of an &#91;E&#93; in brackets is used before a listed register when it must be a 32-bit
 value with a 32-bit selector and a 16-bit value with a 16-bit selector.
<br><br>Required registers that are not specified in this list should be set up in the same way as required for normal DOS
 real mode operation.&nbsp; For INT APIs that are not listed and require segemnt pointers, either handle them using the CauseWay
 IntXX function or create your own interrupt translation code.

<br>INT 23h Control-C Handler Address
<br><br>This interrupt is always reflected back to the protected mode handler to ensure the CauseWay application can handle
 it correctly.&nbsp; The default handler aborts the application in the same manner as DOS.&nbsp; If you need to terminate
 your application in your own handler, perform an INT 21h AH=4ch as normal.
<br><br>INT 24h Critical Error Handler Address
<br><br>This interrupt is always reflected back to the protected mode handler to ensure the CauseWay application can handle
 it correctly.&nbsp; The default handler behaves in the same way as the DOS handler and it aborts your application, if appropriate.
&nbsp; If you install your own handler, all memory accessed by this interrupt as code or data must be locked.
<br><br>The register values normally placed on the stack by DOS before entry to the interrupt handler are not present in protected
 mode.&nbsp; Only the register values are valid.&nbsp; You may terminate your application from within this interrupt with
 INT 21h, AH=4ch as normal.

<br>17h &#91;E&#93;DX instead of DX
<br>Notes:
<br><br>With the exception of software interrupts that require segment pointers as parameters, all interrupts can be issued
 as normal.&nbsp; The most common interrupt APIs that require segment pointers are intercepted by CauseWay to provide normal
 access to these services.&nbsp; Any other real mode interrupt services that require segment pointers can be accessed using
 CauseWay's simulated real mode interrupt/far call services.
<br><br>Hardware interrupts are always reflected to protected mode handlers even when signaled during real mode operations.
&nbsp; This ensures that protected mode applications always retain control without requiring you to patch real mode interrupt
 vectors.&nbsp; The remaining interrupts are serviced via the vector table appropriate to the mode.&nbsp; Use the real to
 protected mode callback services to provide real mode code with access to protected mode code, and allow any interrupt to
 be re-signaled in protected mode.
<br><br>If you add your own hardware interrupt handlers, suchas the timer tick at vector 08h, any memory that the handler
 reads or writes, including its code, must reside in locked memory.&nbsp; (CauseWay provides a locked stack.) This limitation
 is required because DOS is not re-entrant and hardware interrupts can occur at any time.&nbsp; Interrupts occurring during
 DOS activity prevent CauseWay's virtual memory manager from accessing its swap file.&nbsp; Lock memory will not move to the
 swap file.
<h1 id="Troubleshooting"> Troubleshooting </h1>
<h2 id="First_Steps"> First Steps </h2>
<br>If you have problems using CauseWay, first try linking and running a one-line program that simply prints &quot;Hello&quot;
 on your computer screen.&nbsp; This will help establish if the problem is a basic incompatibility with CauseWay and your
 system setup, or if the error may lie elsewhere (e.g.&nbsp; a third party library).
<br><br>The remainder of this chapter provides a description of error and warning messages that you may encounter when using
 CauseWay.&nbsp; Suggested solutions to correct the errors are included where possible.
<h2 id="DOS_Extender_Error_Messages_and_Return_Values"> DOS Extender Error Messages and Return Values </h2>
<br>DOS extender error messages are displayed by the CauseWay DOS extender when a CauseWay application is running and encounters
 a serious problem that it cannot recover from.&nbsp; The DOS extender then terminates the application with the appropriate
 return code, displaying a dump of register values, and writing system information to the file CW.ERR.
<h2 id="01_Unable_to_resize_program_memory_block_"> 01 Unable to resize program memory block. </h2>
<br>Generated if DOS reports an error when CauseWay tries to resize its real mode memory block.&nbsp; As the block is always
 shrunk, the only possible cause of this is corrupted memory control blocks (MCBs).&nbsp; Reboot the system to correct this
 error.
<h2 id="02_386_or_better_required_"> 02 386 or better required. </h2>
<br>Generated if CauseWay is run on any machine with a processor below a 386SX.&nbsp; To correct this error, run the application
 on another machine or upgrade the machine's processor.
<h2 id="03_NonMstandard_protected_mode_program_already_active_"> 03 Non-standard protected mode program already active. </h2>
<br>Generated if the system is already operating under the control of another protected mode program which doesn't conform
 to either VCPI or DPMI standards.&nbsp; Identify and remove the other application before running the CauseWay application.
<h2 id="04_DOS_3_1_or_better_required_"> 04 DOS 3.1 or better required. </h2>
<br>Generated if DOS version is less than 3.1.&nbsp; You need to upgrade the machine's DOS version or use another machine
 to operate the CauseWay application.
<h2 id="05_Not_enough_memory_for_CauseWay_"> 05 Not enough memory for CauseWay. </h2>
<br>Generated if the system doesn't have enough free physical memory to initialize the CauseWay kernel code and data.&nbsp;
 Free additional memory before running the CauseWay application.&nbsp; The memory can be any of the extended or conventional
 types supported by CauseWay.
<h2 id="06_VCPI_failed_to_switch_into_protected_mode_"> 06 VCPI failed to switch into protected mode. </h2>
<br>Generated if a VCPI server is detected and the server fails to switch into protected mode when requested.&nbsp; The only
 likely cause of this error is a corrupted system.&nbsp; Reboot the system and try again.
<h2 id="07_Unable_to_control_A20_"> 07 Unable to control A20. </h2>
<br>Generated if CauseWay detects an A20 line that doesn't respond to the normal control methods.&nbsp; This may indicate
 either a hardware fault or a nonstandard system.&nbsp; There is no software solution for these hardware problems.&nbsp; Installing
 an XMS driver such as HIMEM.SYS should address nonstandard systems.
<h2 id="08_Selector_allocation_error_"> 08 Selector allocation error. </h2>
<br>Generated if DPMI refuses to allocate enough selectors for CauseWay to function.&nbsp; Remove one or more programs that
 are also using DPMI.
<h2 id="09_Unrecoverable_exception__Program_terminated_"> 09 Unrecoverable exception.&nbsp; Program terminated. </h2>
<br>This is the standard General Protection Fault, or GPF, message.&nbsp; It is generated if a nonrecoverable exception occurs
 which suggests a bug in the application.&nbsp; Use the register dump displayed with this message along with the information
 in CW.ERR and the program's .MAP file to help track down the location and cause of the problem.
<h2 id="10_Unable_to_find_application_to_load_"> 10 Unable to find application to load. </h2>
<br>Generated if CauseWay is unable to find the application within the executable .EXE file.&nbsp; This situation indicates
 a corrupted file.&nbsp; Rebuild or obtain another copy of the application.
<h2 id="11_DOS_reported_error_while_accessing_application_"> 11 DOS reported error while accessing application. </h2>
<br>Generated if any kind of error is detected while accessing the CauseWay application executable file.&nbsp; This situation
 indicates a corrupted or missing file.&nbsp; Rebuild or obtain another copy of the application.
<h2 id="12_Not_enough_memory_to_load_application_"> 12 Not enough memory to load application. </h2>
<br>Generated if CauseWay is unable to provide enough memory to load the application.&nbsp; Free additional memory and/or
 disk space before running the application.&nbsp; Check for CAUSEWAY=SWAP, TEMP and TMP environment variables that point to
 a disk with little free space.&nbsp; If running under an operating system that provides DPMI per application, increase the
 application's DPMI allocation.
<h2 id="13_DPMI_failed_to_switch_to_protected_mode_"> 13 DPMI failed to switch to protected mode. </h2>
<br>Generated if the machine is using a DPMI server and it fails to switch to protected mode.&nbsp; If the DPMI server only
 supports multiple clients of the same type (either 16- or 32-bit) then the problem is probably that different types of applications
 are already being run.&nbsp; Remove the other type of DPMI application(s) before running the CauseWay application.
<h2 id="14_Memory_structures_destroyed__Program_terminated_"> 14 Memory structures destroyed.&nbsp; Program terminated. </h2>
<br>Generated if internal memory management structures become corrupted.&nbsp; This is caused by the CauseWay application
 writing to memory regions that have not been allocated to it and is a bug in the application.&nbsp; Obtain a corrected version
 of the application to fix this error.
<h2 id="15_DOS_reported_an_error_while_accessing_swap_file__Program_terminated_"> 15 DOS reported an error while accessing swap file.&nbsp; Program terminated. </h2>
<br>Generated if any level of error is detected while accessing the swap file.&nbsp; The swap file has probably been deleted
 inadvertently by the application or perhaps marked as read-only.
<h2 id="16_Unsupported_DOS_function_call__Program_terminated_"> 16 Unsupported DOS function call.&nbsp; Program terminated. </h2>
<br>The CauseWay application attempted to use an obsolete DOS function which used file control blocks (FCBs).&nbsp; Use the
 file handle DOS functions in the application instead.
