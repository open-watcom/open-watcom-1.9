<h1 id="DDE_Spy"> DDE Spy </h1>
<br>DDE Spy is a debugging tool that allows you to watch all DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) activity occurring in the system.
&nbsp; DDE Spy also allows you to monitor DDEML errors and registration of various DDE objects, such as strings, conversations,
 links, and servers.&nbsp; DDE is one way for different applications running under Windows to communicate with each other.
<br><br>By watching the communications between applications, you can determine if the information being sent is correct.&nbsp;
 If it does not seem correct you can locate the cause of the error.
<h2 id="Using_DDE_Spy"> Using DDE Spy </h2>
<br>This section discusses the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Starting DDE Spy

<br><b><i>Figure 3.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Open Watcom DDE Spy toolbar.</b>
<h2 id="The_DDE_Spy_Event_List"> The DDE Spy Event List </h2>
<br>Opening DDE Spy reveals an empty window.&nbsp; This is the event list where DDE Spy logs the information you define in
 the Monitor menu.&nbsp; Some examples of events are strings being created or deleted and conversations and links being established
 or terminated.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 4.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Once you start spying, the event list displays the information selected for monitoring.</b>
<br><br>This section describes the tasks you can perform in relation to the event list.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Setting_the_Font"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Setting the Font </h3>
<br>The Font item in the File menu allows you to set the font, style, and size for the text in the DDE Spy window.&nbsp; Choosing
 this item opens the Font dialog box.&nbsp; Select the desired font details and click on OK to close the dialog and apply
 the fonts.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Saving_the_Event_List_to_a_File"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Saving the Event List to a File </h3>
<br>The Save items in the File menu allow you to save the contents of the event list to a text file.&nbsp; Saving information
 to a file enables you to print the output later or annotate the text file on-line.
<br><br>Choose Save from the File menu in the Open Watcom DDE Spy window to save the event list information into the current
 working directory.&nbsp; A message box appears indicating the path to which DDE Spy saved the file.
<br><br>Choose Save As from the File menu to specify the file to which you want to save the event list information.&nbsp;
 This opens a Save As dialog box where you select the desired file.&nbsp; Click on OK when completed.&nbsp; A message box
 appears indicating the path to which DDE Spy saved the file.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Clearing_the_Event_List"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Clearing the Event List </h3>
<br>Choose Clear from the File menu to delete all information from the current event list.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Marking_the_Event_List"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Marking the Event List </h3>
<br>Use the Mark function to annotate the information in the event list by entering text into it.
<dl>
<dt>To mark the event list :
<dd>
<dt><br>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Mark</b> from the output menu.
<br>This opens the Set Mark dialog box.
<br><br><tt><img src="drw2.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 5.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> With the Set Mark dialog, you can annotate the event list by entering text and
 choosing a mark style.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Type the desired text</b> in the Enter Mark Text field.
<br>The text you enter will appear at the end of the event list
<dt><br>(3)
<dd><b> Select the desired Mark Style option.</b>
<br>These options determine how the entered text is formatted when it is added to the event list When the boxed option is
 selected, the text is displayed bordered by asterisks.&nbsp; With this option the text is easier to find.&nbsp; When the
 plain option is selected, the text is displayed as it is entered.
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> when completed.
<br>The Set Mark dialog closes and the text in the dialog appears at the end of the event list.
</dl>
<br><tt><img src="drw3.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 6.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> Text you enter in the Set Mark dialog appears in the event list in the selected
 style.</b>
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Pausing_the_Event_List_Output"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Pausing the Event List Output </h3>
<br>The Output to Screen item in the Output menu allows you to temporarily stop writing information to the event list.&nbsp;
 When this menu item is unchecked output will not be written to the event list.&nbsp; Although DDE Spy stops writing information
 to the event list, it still writes it to the log file if you are currently creating a log file.&nbsp; When DDE Spy is not
 writing information to the event list applications will run sightly faster so when you are not interested in viewing the
 event list you may want to stop writing to it.
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>If you mark the event list while the Output to Screen feature is deactivated, the text you enter does not appear in the event
 list.
</dl>
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Automatic_Scrolling"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Automatic Scrolling </h3>
<br>As DDE Spy writes new information to the event list, the information is added to the bottom of the list.&nbsp; Checking
 the Auto Scroll item in the Output menu tells DDE Spy to automatically scroll the information in the event list so that the
 most recent information written to the event list always appears on the screen.
<br><br>When the Auto Scroll menu item not checked you must use the scroll bar to scroll down and view any new information
 that is added to the event list.
<h2 id="Selecting_Information_to_Monitor"> Selecting Information to Monitor </h2>
<br>The monitor menu contains items that let you specify the types of DDE events that DDE Spy will report on by recording
 them in the event list.&nbsp; Limiting the amount of information logged makes reading the event list more efficient.
<br><br>When an item appears in the menu with a checkmark, DDE Spy reports on that type of activity.&nbsp; The following describes
 various types of activity DDE Spy can monitor.
<dl>
<dt>Posted Messages
<dd>When the Posted Messages item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list whenever a DDE message that has been selected
 using the Message Filter dialog is posted to an application's message queue.
<dt><br>Sent Messages
<dd>When the Sent Messages item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list whenever a DDE message that has been selected
 using the Message Filter dialog is sent to an application.
<dt><br>String Handle Data
<dd>DDE applications use strings to communicate with other applications.&nbsp; These strings are registered with the operating
 system by the applications using them.&nbsp; When done with the strings, the applications tell the operating system they
 are done and the system destroys the strings.&nbsp; DDE Spy reports on all string operations that occur within the system
 when the String Handle Data menu item is checked.
<dt><br>Callbacks
<dd>Callbacks are special functions called by the operating system to process DDE messages.&nbsp; When the Callback item is checked
 DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list each time the operating system calls a DDE Callback for a transaction type that
 has been selected using the Callback Filter dialog.
<dt><br>Errors
<dd>A DDE error usually indicates that a DDE operation has failed.&nbsp; When the Errors item is checked, DDE Spy reports all
 DDE errors that occur within the system.
<dt><br>Conversations
<dd>A conversation is the connection established between two applications that is necessary to perform DDE operations.&nbsp; When
 the Conversations item is checked, DDE Spy makes an entry in the event list each time a conversation is established or terminated.
<dt><br>Links
<dd>A link is a relationship between two DDE applications:&nbsp; a server and a client.&nbsp; A link is established for a single
 value maintained by the server.&nbsp; When this value changes the server notifies the client.&nbsp; When the Links item is
 checked, DDE Spy logs notifications in the event list each time a link is established or terminated.
</dl>
<h3 id="Setting_the_Message_Filter"> Setting the Message Filter </h3>
<br>The Set Message Filter item opens the Message Filter dialog which lists the various DDE messages that can be posted or
 sent.&nbsp; This dialog allows you to select the specific messages you want DDE Spy to write to the event list.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde5.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 7.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Set Message Filter dialog, select the messages on which you want DDE Spy
 to report.</b>
<br><br>Select the messages that you want DDE Spy to report on when posted or sent.&nbsp; A message is activated when its
 check box contains a check.
<ul>
<li>Use the Set All button in this dialog to activate all of the messages.
<li>Use the Clear All button in this dialog to deactivate all of the messages.
</ul>
<br>Click on OK when the desired messages are activated.
<h3 id="Setting_the_Callback_Filter"> Setting the Callback Filter </h3>
<br>The Set Callback Filter menu item opens the Callback Filter dialog which lists the various types of transactions for which
 a DDE callback function may be called.&nbsp; This dialog allows you to specify the transaction types you want DDE Spy to
 report in the event list.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde6.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 8.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Set Callback Filter dialog, select the transaction types on which you
 want DDE Spy to report.</b>
<br><br>Select the transaction types on which you want DDE Spy to report.&nbsp; A transaction type will be reported on when
 its check box contains a check.
<ul>
<li>Use the Set All button in this dialog to activate all of the transaction types.
<li>Use the Clear All button in this dialog to deactivate all of the transaction types.
</ul>
<br>Click on OK when the desired transaction types are activated.
<h2 id="DDE_Spy__Working_with_Log_Files"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Working with Log Files </h2>
<br>By writing the information in the event list to a log file, you have a file you can look at in case a program you are
 running terminates your applications.&nbsp; In such a situation, your event list is lost so you have no information to refer
 to when debugging.&nbsp; Writing to a log file also allows you to print the output later or annotate the text file on-line.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Configuring_the_Log_File"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Configuring the Log File </h3>
<br>Choosing Configure Log from the File menu opens the Log Configuration dialog where you customize DDE Spy's behaviour when
 it logs to a file.&nbsp; This dialog contains four sections where you specify information.
<br><br><tt><img src="spy10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 9.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Log Configuration dialog you set the desired behaviour for DDE Spy when
 logging to a file.</b>
<h4 id="DDE_Spy__Default_Log_Name"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Default Log Name </h4>
<br>In the Default Log Name field, specify the file to which DDE Spy writes when you begin logging.&nbsp; Clicking the Browse
 button next to this field opens a Choose Log Name dialog that lets you browse your file structure while choosing the log
 name.
<h4 id="DDE_Spy__Log_Name"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Log Name </h4>
<br>The settings in the Log Name section of the dialog indicate to DDE Spy how the name of the log file should be determined
 when the Log to File menu item is chosen.
<br><br>When the Query for Log Name option is selected, DDE Spy presents a prompt each time you select Log to File from the
 File menu or the toolbar.&nbsp; This reveals a Choose Log Name dialog where you specify the file to which DDE Spy writes
 the log information.
<br><br>When the Use Default Log Name option is selected, DDE Spy writes the log information to the file indicated in the
 Default Log Name field in the Log Configuration dialog.&nbsp; No prompt appears.
<h4 id="DDE_Spy__Action_When_Log_File_Exists"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Action When Log File Exists </h4>
<br>The options in the Action When Log File Exists section of the Log Configuration dialog dictate how DDE Spy behaves when
 you choose Log to File and a log file already exists.
<dl>
<dt>Replace
<dd>DDE Spy writes over the existing log file.&nbsp; All information in the existing file is lost.
<dt><br>Append
<dd>DDE Spy adds the new information to the end of the existing log file.
<dt><br>Query
<dd>DDE Spy prompts you with a message box that allows you to choose a course of action-Replace, Append, or Cancel.
</dl>
<br><tt><img src="spy11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 10.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Log Information message box appears when logging if the Query option is
 selected on the Log Configuration dialog.</b>
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Start_Logging"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Start Logging </h3>
<br>Choosing Log to File from the File menu tells DDE Spy to write all new information added to the event list to the log
 file.&nbsp; Depending on the options selected in the Log Configuration dialog, the following dialogs may appear when you
 choose Log to File:
<ul>
<li>Choose Log Name dialog-On this dialog you specify the file to which DDE Spy writes the log information.
<li>Log Information dialog-On this dialog you choose a course of action for logging when the specified log file already exists.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Note:
<dd>Choosing Cancel on either of these dialogs closes the dialog and prevents logging from starting.
</dl>
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Logging_Type"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Logging Type </h3>
<br>There are two ways to write information to the log file:&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li>Continuous Logging
<li>Periodic Logging
</ul>
<br>If the Continuous Logging option is activated, then as DDE Spy writes information to the event list, it simultaneously
 writes to a log file.
<br><br>When the Periodic Logging option is activated, DDE Spy writes information to the log file only after a reasonable
 amount of information, as determined by the application, has been recorded in the event list
<br><br>Periodic logging is more convenient because it is faster than continuous logging.&nbsp; However, if your system goes
 down, some information will be lost.&nbsp; By simultaneously writing to the log file and the message list, continuous logging
 allows you to store all information in a log file without the chance of losing information.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Stop_Logging"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Stop Logging </h3>
<br>Once the log is started, DDE Spy continues writing to the log file until you stop logging.&nbsp; A check mark beside the
 Log to File item in the File menu indicates that a log is being created.&nbsp; Choose this item again to stop logging.
<h3 id="DDE_Spy__Pause_Logging"> DDE Spy:&nbsp; Pause Logging </h3>
<br>To temporarily stop writing information to the log file you can choose the Pause Log item from the File menu.&nbsp; A
 check mark appears beside the item indicating that the log is currently paused.&nbsp; To restart logging, choose this item
 again from the File menu.
<h2 id="Tracking_with_DDE_Spy"> Tracking with DDE Spy </h2>
<br>In the process of DDE interactions programs register and unregister several types of DDE objects such as:
<ul>
<li>Strings
<li>Conversations
<li>Links
<li>Servers
</ul>
<br>The tracking windows offer you an easy way to determine at any time which objects are currently registered with the system.
<br><br>To open a tracking window choose Strings, Conversations, Links or Servers from the Track menu.&nbsp; This opens a
 tracking window that displays all the objects of the selected type that have been registered but not unregistered since DDE
 Spy started.&nbsp; The tracking windows are automatically updated whenever an event occurs that changes the displayed information.
<br><br>Each tracking window lists its information in tabular form under several headings.&nbsp; You can sort the displayed
 information based on any column by clicking on the column heading for that column.
<h3 id="Tracking_Strings"> Tracking Strings </h3>
<br>Choose Strings from the Track menu to open a Strings window which tracks all strings currently registered with the operating
 system.&nbsp; As strings are destroyed, DDE Spy removes them from the list.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde9.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 11.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Strings window tracks all strings currently registered with the operating
 system.</b>
<br><br>The information in this window is:
<dl>
<dt>Handle
<dd>The unique numeric identifier for the string
<dt><br>Count
<dd>The current usage count of the string.&nbsp; A string is deleted when its usage count is zero.
<dt><br>String
<dd>The text of the registered string
</dl>
<h3 id="Tracking_Conversations"> Tracking Conversations </h3>
<br>Choose Conversations from the Track menu to open a Conversations window which tracks all conversations currently active
 in the system.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde10.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 12.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Conversations window tracks all conversations currently active in the system.</b>
<br><br>The information in this window is:
<dl>
<dt>Client
<dd>The unique numeric identifier for the client
<dt><br>Server
<dd>The unique numeric identifier for the server
<dt><br>Service
<dd>The service name specified when the conversation was established
<dt><br>Topic
<dd>The topic specified by the client when the conversation was established
</dl>
<h3 id="Tracking_Links"> Tracking Links </h3>
<br>Choose Links from the Track menu to open a Links window which tracks all links currently active in the system.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde11.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 13.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Links window tracks all links currently active in the system.</b>
<br><br>The information in this window is:
<dl>
<dt>Client
<dd>The unique numeric identifier for the client
<dt><br>Server
<dd>The unique numeric identifier for the server
<dt><br>Type
<dd>A value indicating if the link is Hot or Warm.&nbsp; When a link is established between a client and server, the server notifies
 the client whenever the value of the item changes.&nbsp; When the link type is Warm, the only information sent to the client
 is notification that the value of the item has changed.&nbsp; When the link type is Hot, then the notification that the value
 has changed is sent to the client as well as the new value of the item.
<dt><br>Service
<dd>The service name specified when the conversation on which this link exists was established
<dt><br>Topic
<dd>The topic specified by the client when the conversation was established.
<dt><br>Item
<dd>The name of the item for which the link is established.
<dt><br>Format
<dd>The format of the information that is being communicated between applications.
</dl>
<h3 id="Tracking_Servers"> Tracking Servers </h3>
<br>Choose Servers from the Track menu to open a Servers window which tracks all servers currently registered with the operating
 system.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde12.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 14.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> The Servers window tracks all servers currently registered with the operating
 system.</b>
<br><br>The information in this dialog is:
<dl>
<dt>Server Name
<dd>The name of each server that is registered with the operating system.&nbsp; This name is generally descriptive of the type
 of server.
<dt><br>Instance Name
<dd>The server name with a numeric identifier added by the operating system.&nbsp; This name uniquely identifies the server in
 the system.
</dl>
<h2 id="Working_with_Aliases"> Working with Aliases </h2>
<br>The event list displays an overwhelming array of numeric identifiers.&nbsp; The alias functions allow you to replace these
 numeric identifiers with meaningful text.&nbsp; This makes the event list easier for you to understand.&nbsp; For example,
 if you are monitoring a server application and you know it's task id is 0x1234 then you can replace every occurrence of that
 task id with the text &quot;server&quot;.
<h3 id="Defining_Aliases"> Defining Aliases </h3>
<br>Using the alias functions you can define aliases for window handles, task id's and conversation id's.
<dl>
<dt>(1)
<dd><b> Choose Add hwnd alias, Add task alias or Add conversation alias</b> from the Alias menu
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Click on the appropriate icon on the toolbar.</b>
<br>This opens the appropriate Add Alias dialog.&nbsp; The dialog contains a list box that lists all identifiers of the chosen
 type that DDE Spy has encountered.
<br><br><tt><img src="dde13.bmp" style="vertical-align:middle"></tt>
<br><b><i>Figure 15.</i></b><b><i></i></b><b> In the Add Alias dialog box, you replace the selected window handle, task, or
 conversation id with descriptive text.</b>
<dt><br>(2)
<dd><b> Click once on the window handle, task, or conversation</b> for which you want to add an alias
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Enter a numeric value in the Value field.</b>

<dd><b> Position the cursor in the Current Text field.</b>
<dt><br>(4)
<dd><b> Enter the text</b> with which you want to replace this numeric identifier.
<dt><br>(5)
<dd><b> Click on OK</b> to register the alias and close the dialog
<br>or
<dt><br>
<dd><b> Select the Do More button</b> to register the alias and leave the dialog open.
<br>This allows you to create aliases for more numeric identifiers.
</dl>
<h3 id="Disabling_Aliases"> Disabling Aliases </h3>
<br>Choosing Disable Aliases from the Aliases menu changes all aliased values back to their original numeric identifiers.
&nbsp; The Disable Aliases menu item is checked when this option is active.&nbsp; Choosing the menu item again disables it.
&nbsp; Numeric identifiers are then replaced by their text aliases again.
<h3 id="Purging_Aliases"> Purging Aliases </h3>
<br>Choosing Purge Aliases from the Aliases menu deletes all aliases set up in DDE Spy.&nbsp; Any values replaced by aliases
 will revert to their original numeric values.
